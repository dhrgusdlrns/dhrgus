"Anton discovered a problem with the Missile Pod. The magnetic clamps refuse to disengage even after powering down. Niklas says he can get in and rewire it, but recommends moving the pod to the upper transport shaft in case it goes off, that way it'll only fire a hole into the upper loading bay (which we can cheaply repair) instead of knocking a hole in the side of the shop (a lot less cheap). He says it should work, but he needs a little more time. I recommended doing this outside, but we've already started stripping down the engines, and our tow's currently out of commission, so the ship's gotta stay in the garage.\n"

"[This aptly named book contains information about the founding members of the Trackers Alliance, including this crib sheet summary of the original five members]\n"
"\n"
"Elias Zaxx\n"
"An ex-mercenary who fought on both side of the Narion War. As a soldier for hire, his only allegiance was with who was currently keeping him on their payroll. When the war ended, and his services were no longer required, he turned his skills towards bounty hunting, and didn't look back. He was able to leverage his connections within the United Colonies and Freestar Collective to help broker the deal that would eventually lead towards legitimacy for the Trackers Alliance.\n"
"\n"
"Bertha Mondu\n"
"Frequent Spacer attacks plagued Bertha's homestead, which she famously defended. One day, while she was gathering supplies from an off-world outpost, Spacers came and murdered her entire family. After getting revenge and bringing those responsible to justice, she turned her sights towards other fugitives and criminals. She managed to steal a large Spacer ship and established the first mobile base of operations for the Trackers Alliance, a ship called the Falcon.\n"
"\n"
"Bong-cha Noe\n"
"A former assassin for hire working for the now defunct Automyka corporation, until her employer stiffed her and set her up to be caught and disposed of. She managed to turn the tables, and systematically killed the entire corporate board one by one, after uncovering their terrible crimes. It led to the entire corporation dissolving within a few short months. Until joining the Trackers Alliance, she focused her efforts on surreptitiously infiltrating criminal groups and taking them down from within.\n"
"\n"
"Dumitru Vega\n"
"Dumitru was a big game hunter, and the heir to billions of credits. After conquering the biggest and toughest alien creature he could find, he determined that the only thing left was to hunt the most dangerous game: other humans. His advisors informed him that would be illegal until he insisted they find him a legal way to do it. And so, he turned to legitimate freelance bounty hunting and he met up with the other members of the fledgling Trackers Alliance. As such, he was instrumental in financing the early Trackers Alliance. To this day, when Trackers need to requisition credits or other provisions from the Trackers Alliance supply, it's called \"dipping into the Vega Fund.\"\n"
"\n"
"Badger\n"
"Little is known about Badger. They showed up one day, never showed their face, and reportedly spoke few words. However, they were known for being the best of the best and held the record for bringing in the most bounties in Tracker history for nearly 100 years. Reportedly, they never once let a target get away. Legend has it that they are not only responsible for inspiring the rules and traditions for Agent No. 1, but also the Trackers Alliance motto, \"Leave no quarter. Show no mercy.\""

"[A rather dry book about the extraordinary history of the Trackers Alliance. Below is an excerpt]\n"
"\n"
"2217 was a different time - just a year after the Treaty of Narion was signed, signaling the end of a twenty year long war. But while the war had raged, issues of all kinds plagued society. There was hunger, supply chain disruptions, economic uncertainty, and rampant crime, as military and local law enforcement directed most of their resources towards the war efforts.\n"
"\n"
"In the absence of state-sanctioned justice, the people took matters into their own hands in the form of extra-judicial killings to deal with Spacers, pirates, and other violent criminals. The growing problem of private citizens taking matters into their own hands, and either getting themselves or innocents killed in the process was enough to prompt some of those vigilante citizens to band together and work with the governments of the Settled Systems, rather than leave it to said governments to impose their own set of restrictions that could put their livelihoods in jeopardy.\n"
"\n"
"Thus, the Trackers Alliance formed as a officially sanctioned way to work within the system, delivering criminals and the like to the United Colonies or Freestar Collective via an official bounty system. The governments of the Settled Systems found this arrangement to be a benefit, as their own resources to track down and capture dangerous criminals were stretched thin after the war, and who better to deal with the problem than elite trained professionals? On the other hand, it's also a poorly guarded secret that anyone with the resources can hire the Trackers for their own bounty purposes. The system, while far from perfect, still exists today."
