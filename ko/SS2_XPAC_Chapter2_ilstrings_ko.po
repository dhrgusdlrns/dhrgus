msgctxt "[040031AE]"

msgid "They came to that town set to charge straight in. But it was ringed by walls so tall that they all but fell over backwards looking up at em."

msgctxt "[04003185]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04002FD0]"
msgid "An alligator, the size of a school bus. Old Gus the locals called that guy, they had a few stories about him too."

msgctxt "[040030C0]"
msgid "Another decade goes by and they open the door again. It might have been shut even faster than last time when they saw what lay outside."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040031BC]"
msgid "And as water cascades through its slammed shut again. The world must have flooded they reckon, so they set to stay inside for a while longer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04002F52]"
msgid "Ten years later, the kids are growing up and want to see the world outside. So the door is opened again ..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04003028]"
msgid "So, that vault door stays shut, and the overseer retreats to his maintenance pod for some peace and quiet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0400310B]"
msgid "But the vault is now full of middle-aged mothers with young kids, and theyve seen Vault-Tecs info films about the world outside."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040031EB]"
msgid "Twenty years after the bombs, and the vault is due to open its great heavy door, face the world, and start rebuilding."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04002FA5]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0400302C]"
msgid "But guys, stop thinking of those fantasy young women in your head, and replace them with real women you know. Still wanna to be that guy?"

msgctxt "[04002F3D]"
msgid "Then theres the sister vault. Vault 69. One guy in charge of hundreds of young women. Now I know we have some thinking theyd like to be that guy."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0400300C]"
msgid "Course the locals called em Bastard Sons, or worse. From a distance. While shooting back at them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040030EB]"
msgid "For decades, the whole region felt the anger of those hateful men. There and then, the raider gang called the Blazing Sons was born."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040031D9]"
msgid "Of course, it couldnt last. After years of abuse, one day the guys turned the tables on their mistress. Any ladies still jealous?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04002F8D]"
msgid "I dont know about you, but when choosing whos in charge of power or clean water, I dont look for the last guy standing in a boxing ring."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04003068]"
msgid "Now, that Overseer had those guys competing with each other till they were bloody, for every promotion and favor."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04003148]"
msgid "Your fantasy or not, you dont need to be a genius to realize that aint a long term solution for the survival of the species."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0400329D]"
msgid "First off lets head to Vault 68. One sports-coach lady overseer in charge of hundreds of young guys. Any ladies here wishing they had that?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04002FE0]"
msgid "And hey, remember, at this point they didnt know that theyd signed up to be guinea pigs for mad scientists."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040030CC]"
msgid "Vault 68 had gotten all the men folk except their one lady overseer. Then vault 69 got all the women and their one male overseer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040031B3]"
msgid "Well they reckoned something had gone wrong with those buses routes, which wouldnt become apparent until it was far too late to fix."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04002F5D]"
msgid "Well one day the sirens go off and those folks get rushed off to their vaults. Transported in separate buses for men and women."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0400304C]"
msgid "Now unlike most vaults, these two just took in single young adults. Those kids thought that life was going to be party? How do you rate their chances?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04003137]"
msgid "Ive heard tales of a pair of those vaults, 68 and 69. Its said they were built a-ways down south, placed either side of the great Mississippi."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04003224]"
msgid "Yes, of course, they created a bunch of messed up, sadistic experiments to perform on those folks who went to shelter in their vaults."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04002F43]"
msgid "Yet what did those fine people decide to do with their huge budgets and new technologies?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040030FA]"
msgid "They were given the task, of building great shelters, which would protect as many folks as they could."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040031D5]"

msgid "Now the little tato farm, where my family has lived out the years since the war, is never going to make for any interesting tales."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0400324B]"

msgid "Right now, its only me and Lupe here. ...And Aiden. But the more folks we can get to work for us, the more youll be able to talk to!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040235C3]"
msgid "Basically, by adding a few extra lines of code to your Pip-Boy, Ive tricked the Comm Array into treating it like an ASAM!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040235C3]"
msgid "Now, anytime youre in range, the Array will automatically connect to your Pip-Boy, allowing instantaneous - two way communication. Pretty cool, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040235C4]"
msgid "Well, interestingly - your Pip-Boy already had the necessary components for two-way radio. Receiver, speakers, microphone. It even has a transmitter!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040235C4]"
msgid "Albeit - a very small one, only meant for short range. But, thanks to the Comm Array, your transmitter size doesnt really matter."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040235C4]"
msgid "Now that I think about it, theres actually quite a lot of similarities between the internals of an Pip-Boy and an ASAM.... Hmm."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04023596]"
msgid "Dont be so quick to judge..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040235C1]"
msgid "Damn right it is!"

msgctxt "[0402359F]"

msgctxt "[0402359F]"
msgid "Mostly - I coordinate all the different departments. But, Im also often the one left to deal with the undesirable tasks."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04023593]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04023593]"

msgid "*Sigh* Not good. To be perfectly frank with you, the Vault is failing. And I fear theres nothing anyone can do about it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0402355F]"

msgctxt "[04023599]"

msgctxt "[040235BC]"

msgctxt "[040235BC]"
msgid "He seemed unhappy in his role there. And I dont think recent events had helped that feeling."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040235BC]"

msgctxt "[040235F4]"

msgctxt "[04023615]"

msgctxt "[04031377]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0403133E]"
msgid "Use responsibly. Weapons are not my favorite thing to create, but Im trusting youll put them to good use."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04031310]"
msgid "Weve disabled the trap and put everything back together. Im pleased to report that the only damage done was to Cedrics nerves."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04031310]"

msgctxt "[0403132F]"
msgid "Is everything alright?"
msgstr "모든 게 다 괜찮나요?"

msgctxt "[040312F9]"
msgid "Weve finished combing over the Hub components. Its a good thing you and our little visionary had the foresight to assign it to us -before- using them."

msgctxt "[040312F9]"
msgid "Otherwise, its likely you wouldve been down a couple of limbs, some staff, and an entire building."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[040312F9]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04023E27]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04023E07]"
msgid "Ive already spoken to Cassandra, and she seemed willing for her and her crew to take on the task."

msgctxt "[04023E08]"
msgid "But we dont really have anyone like that at the HQ. At least - not yet."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04023E08]"
msgid "So, if youd happen to know anyone whod be up for the challenge, Id suggest you bring em into the fold and get em working on this!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04023D74]"
msgid "So, before we try to integrate any of these parts, we need to learn the function of each of em."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[04023D74]"
msgid "For this, were gonna need a whole team well versed in careful theorizing, experimentation and analysis! ...Were gonna need a bunch of scientists."

msgctxt "[04023E1D]"
