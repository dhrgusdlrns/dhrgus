Within the pages of this manual, we will provide a host of information vital to successfully navigating these tests.\n\nThe Stage One examination requires a minimum fifty-five percent score when taken at week three for spring intakes or week four for fall intakes. These papers are marked by either the MCPs QMB or the SMPCB themselves, dependent on staffing levels at the time of examination. We will go further into the differences in marking styles and preferences in chapter thirty-five. There we will provide tips for finding out in advance who will be marking said papers, and how to balance your study time and answers to achieve the best results. \n\nIn chapter forty-two we will delve into the importance of achieving specific scores in these examinations and how they will affect the individuals academic path in the remaining weeks of training. You may be amazed to discover the differences that scores of sixty, seventy, or eighty percent can make.\n\nFrom chapter sixty-one we will enter the realms of the SMPCBs Stage Two legal examinations. From here the figures become much more interesting, with two whole chapters devoted to the tables and equations required to get the most from what is to follow. \n\nIf you have hopes of gaining positions within specialist units such as BLCU, BADTFL, BPCF, or even MExCU, then chapters eighty through to ninety-two will equip you with the knowledge of the required examination scores for entry.\n\nNot only does the Stage Two examination have a minimum pass score of seventy-five percent, but two additional organizations become involved in the marking and invigilation. These are the MLJB and BLB, details of these organizations and their roles will be described in appendixes twelve B and C.\n\nFor this edition, we have also included an extra twelve chapters on 2075, 2076,  2077 amendments to national policing policies. Providing crucial information relating to various national emergencies and the additional legal powers and rights amendments commencing from such."

msgid "Authors Introduction and Thoughts on Finding a Balance\n\nSome may allege that this book is intent on encouraging police officers to be lazy, to maligner, to avoid their responsibilities. But such an officer would not last long in any force. I might say that encouraging laziness could not be further from the truth, but the fact is, it is not. The furthest from the truth would be encouraging officers to burn out or get themselves and their colleagues killed through recklessness. \n\nSomewhere between those two extremes is a point that I have spent a long career inhabiting. This is a path through the career of a police officer which will keep them far from either a shameful sacking or a heros burial. A middle path of balance and economy of effort. \n\nTake this book for example. A lack of any effort to write it at all might have seemed to cost me nothing. Yet you would not now be reading this passage, and I would not have received any income from its sale. Alternatively, I could have labored every spare minute to get it finished. I might have completed it faster and have received income much earlier. But the contents would have been of less value to its reader, even faulty and prone to errors. Imagine mistaking a do for a don�t when advising whether to rush into a burning building or not. This is the middle path which I hope to guide you all on.\n\n�\n\nGiving Chase\n\nSo, a suspect has spotted you approaching and they have started to run. The first thing you should recognize at this moment is that you have the upper hand, they are afraid of you. This is a good sign of healthy respect for law and order. It shows the criminals, as they should always be, in fear of the police.\n\nDo you give in to animal instincts and immediately give chase? Even though doing so is little more than a roll of the dice, putting your life in the hands of fate. If you catch up with the suspect, then they may be cornered and forced to defend themselves. They could be leading you right into an ambush or other dangers. And its not just your life that youre risking, any other officers with you will be forced to either abandon you to, or join your potential fate.\n\nNo, this is the time for patience. The time to first observe, to look around, and take in the scene. Are there other individuals here who may need to be questioned or protected? Did the suspect leave any evidence behind that needs to be secured? Are there any details about the suspect to be noted down to ensure that they are not forgotten? Is the site itself of high value, and as such, in need of protection? Has anyone called in the incident? If something happens, your colleagues will need to know the details and where to send backup.\n\nOnce you have exhausted any vital reasons to remain at the scene, proceed with caution. Following at a steady pace will allow you to spot any dangers in good time. It also allows you to spot any tracks or dropped evidence. And finally, should you catch up with the suspect, they will likely be more out of breath than you and have the space and time to make a non-violent response.\n\nFinally, when your involvement in the incident is coming to an end, you will have been able to carefully consider your report. A senior officer taking over a scene will always appreciate a clear description and assessment of the situation. Dont be the out-of-breath officer struggling to pass on information, or making a written report so rushed and scribbled as to be unreadable.\n..."

msgid "The Miranda Warning\nOften referred to as Miranda rights, they are familiar to almost everyone due to their frequent, but often only partial, use in crime holo-films and radio dramas. \n\nThe warning is given by police to criminal suspects being taken into custody or commencing custodial interrogation. It advises the suspect of their right to silence (covered in more depth in its own chapter), specifically, their right to refuse to answer questions or otherwise provide information to law enforcement or other officials. And thus preserving their Fifth Amendment rights against compelled self-incrimination (see Fifth Amendment chapter for more details).\n\nFrom an enforcement perspective, the primary purpose of giving this notification is to ensure that any statements provided by the suspect are admissible in later criminal proceedings.\n\nThe language used originates from the 1966 U.S. Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona (see case appendix for more details). \n\nThe exact wording may vary between jurisdictions, as long as the warning adequately sets out the defendants rights are properly disclosed so that any waiver of those rights by the defendant is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. \nHere is an example of the wording: \nYou have the right to remain silent. \nAnything you say can be used against you in court. \nYou have the right to talk to a lawyer for advice before we ask you any questions. \nYou have the right to have a lawyer with you during questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be appointed for you before any questioning if you wish. \nIf you decide to answer questions now without a lawyer present, you have the right to stop answering at any time.\n\nWaiver\nSimply notifying the suspect of their rights is not the end of the process. The suspect must also voluntarily waive their Miranda rights before questioning can proceed. This waiver must be knowing and intelligent and it must be voluntary. While an express waiver is not necessary, most law enforcement agencies use written waiver forms. These include questions designed to confirm that the suspect expressly waived their rights. Such as, Do you understand each of these rights? or Understanding each of these rights, do you now wish to speak to the police without a lawyer being present?\n\nThe Six Rules\nFor the Miranda to apply, six requirements must be fulfilled:\n(See legal definitions appendix for details)\n1. Evidence must have been gathered.\n2. The evidence must be testimonial.\n3. The evidence must have been obtained while the suspect was in custody.\n4. The evidence must have been the product of interrogation.\n5. The interrogation must have been conducted by state agents.\n6. The evidence must be offered by the state during a criminal prosecution.\n\nExceptions\nThere are three exceptions to the Miranda rules.\nThe routine booking question exception.\nThe jailhouse information exception.\nThe public safety exception.\n\nThe first two exceptions come down to the fact that they refer to purely administrative questions rather than any form of interrogation.\nThe third is a much more complex concern and deserves more detail.\n\nThe Public Safety Exception\nThe public safety exception is a limited and case-specific exception, allowing certain unadvised statements (given without Miranda warnings) to be admissible into evidence at trial when they were elicited in circumstances where there was a great danger to public safety. For more detail on the first introduction of this exception, refer to New York v. Quarles (1984) (see case appendix for more details). \n\nThis first case uses the example of a suspect being apprehended with an empty holster and allowed the question where�s the gun? to be asked prior to any Miranda warning. Another example given was a case of a suspected bomber being asked which wire do I cut to disarm the bomb?.\n\nWhile it can be argued that this exception was intended to be used in the urgent first moments of the apprehension of a suspect, the events of recent years have tested this assumption. Increasing unrest across the U.S. (and occupied territories) during the years of conflict with China has presented law enforcement with many challenging situations. Individuals suspected of infiltration for the Chinese (or other nations) or treasonous behavior, have been permitted increasingly long periods of interrogations without requiring notification of Miranda rights. \n\nAt the time of writing, periods of up to 48 hours are not uncommon, and should treason, sabotage, or espionage be proven, all rights may now be withdrawn (See the Emergency Powers Chapter for more information).\n\nAs with many of the emergency powers, there have been some protests about the use of this exception. After several of these protestors were found to have been guilty of treasonous actions, and subsequently executed, the protests petered out."

msgid "Old Reliable, The 10mm Pistol and You.\n\nNow, dont you even think about skipping past this little feller in favor of the big sexy weapons further on. The 10mm pistol in its various guises should be the bedrock of your firearms knowledge. \n\nThe changeover from 9mm to 10mm as the standard caliber of sidearms for the U.S. military and law enforcement was a key moment that marked our move into the 21st century. It gave the cop on the street a reliable increase in firepower without sacrificing ammunition capacity. And its chunkier build gave increased confidence to its user and second thoughts to the perps it was pointed at. \n\nThe most popular models in production today are the N99 and Colt 6520. If you find yourself in the western states youll find that the Colt models are favored. Colt likes to keep one foot in the past, so their retro-style models employ a revolving chamber. While their modern engineering does give it a 12 round capacity, theres no room for expanding on that, short of a major rebuild. \n\nIn the east of the country, the N99 is preferred. This particular model was introduced following the phasing out of the N80 in 2051. The base model is semi-automatic with a 12 round clip, and the whole range has a great variety of optional customizations.\n\nBoth models have been designed to withstand the most extreme conditions, as one of the requirements for gaining service sidearm contracts. They are designed to be repaired easily in the field, by even the least experienced users, without needing to rely on specialist armorers. \n\n\nGoing Full-Auto \nThe N99 is designed to be fitted with an automatic receiver, turning it into a sub-machinegun (SMG). One of many optional receivers designed to fit the standard body. Colt opted instead to give their users the option of going out to buy an HK MP9 instead.\n\nOptics\nA number of simple sights are available to fit via a standard slide-on mechanism. For those who just have to have the highest tech solutions, the N-series now has a recon-scope option. This chunky little feller can be linked to various HUD systems via a standard RobCo software interface. Once linked, information about a targets range and position will be constantly available until youve taken them down.\n\nTo suppress or not to suppress? \nWell, if youre some kind of hitman, then get the heck out of here. If not, then no, what are you even thinking? The clue is in the name, it isnt just the sound that the thing is suppressing. Its weighing down the end of your barrel making aiming harder. Its taking energy out of each shot, so less range and power. That bang youre thinking of suppressing is doing its best to scare the heck out of your target. Do you really want them to be able to concentrate on shooting back at you? And finally, half the point of using a pistol is its small size, you stick that thing on the end, you might as well be using a carbine.\n\nSo, thats our little old reliable friend, the 10mm Pistol. The next time you get a chance to put a few rounds through one think about this and get to it.\n\n..."

Unfortunately progress is slow. I feel like I really have to earn the local trust before they will open up to me. Key players include\nJake - Very Technically skilled and is driving the rebuilding efforts here.\nElias and Ruby Thompson - Father and Daughter. Elias is a skilled hunter and will come in useful for town defence. \nAlyssa S - Very focussed woman whose main drive appears to be to setup a newspaper. Appears to harbour deep dislike for Super Mutants. \nDylan and Carnal (SM). Dylan is a local tailor that has set up a clothes shop together with a tame Super Mutant (Carnal). Carnal appears to be stable but keeping an eye on her(it?) as there appears to be some anti super mutant sentiment in some of the townspeople. \nHarriet - Reformed thief.

When he regained consciousness later that night, Caleb was the only one left alive. He saw that bodies were strewn everywhere. One corpse, which had been burned to a crisp, he identified as his wife, Madison, by the locket which she always wore around her neck.\n\nIt has been decided to allow Caleb to lead this investigation. His familiarity with the gang suspected of the crime and his determination to see the criminals brought to justice make him the only possible choice. \n\nIntelligence indicates that there are links to the new settlement developing in Concord. As such, Caleb will be setting up a CPD presence there."

Two were wearing all enclosing white suits and as such have little to identify them. The third was described as bald, with a scarred face, wearing a leather jacket, and carrying a large caliber handgun.\n\nThey approached and opened up the chamber containing the witnesss wife and child. The bald man demanded that the spouse hand over the infant, and when they refused, shot them dead with a single shot from the handgun.\n\nThe three then closed the victims chamber and refroze the witness before leaving with the infant.\n\nThe witness then woke again on Oct 23rd, 2287, and confirmed that their spouse was dead and their child was missing. They also report that all of the others who had been frozen were also dead.\n\nOfficers should keep this case in mind should they come across any male kidnapping victims of any age. Whether the childs parent is aware or not, the nature of the crime prevents us from pinning down when it happened to any more than, some point in the preceding two centuries."

The then occupant of the premises, Viola Kneib, was arrested under suspicion of handling stolen goods.\n\nEfforts to decipher the logs have begun to reveal enough information to confirm that Ms. Kneib was knowingly buying and selling stolen items. She has now even begun to provide some additional information in a mixture of pride and relief.\n\nBetween interrogations and the logs, we are gradually putting together a record of where many of the items she moved on actually ended up. Operations are being put in place to recover as many of these items recovered as possible. They can then be returned to their original owners, once they are no longer required as evidence in Ms. Kneibs upcoming trial.\n\nThree of these items are thought to be located in areas deemed to be hazardous.

Contact with sick animals or their carcasses is a major source of infection in settlers.\n\nObserved cases of anthrax to date have all been identified as gastrointestinal, but infections can also be from inhalation and cutaneous entry. Symptoms will vary depending on the type of infection, but all types have the potential to cause serious illness and even death without proper treatment. \n\nInfections can take from one day to two months to develop. When an anthrax infection spreads through a patient�s body, its spores release toxins that are responsible for causing severe illness.\n\n(While they�re infected, you will find your people foggy and unresponsive. They should keep their performance in labor jobs, but if their job requires focus or mental acuity you may want to make sure they aren�t working on anything critical. - Cassandra)\n\nGastrointestinal Infections\nTransmitted via ingesting bacteria from dirty hands or contaminated foods.\n\n(Easily avoided by not ingesting undercooked food or dirt. Reminding settlers to wash their hands, fingernails, and harvested food ahead of time would go a long way. I would also encourage them to stop using the �five minute rule� with food that fell on the ground, but I shouldn�t throw stones in glass houses... - Cassandra)\n\nSymptoms can include: Fever, chills, swelling of neck glands, sore throat, nausea, vomiting (often bloody), diarrhea (sometimes bloody), headaches, confusion, fatigue, stomach pains, fainting, and swollen abdomen.\n\nInhalation Infection\nTransmitted via airborne particles from coughs and sneezes from infected individuals.\n \n(Again, preventable if people cover their mouths and not cough over each other. The uninfected should remember the value of personal space. - Cassandra)\n\nSymptoms can include. Fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, confusion, coughing, stomach pains, nausea, vomiting, headaches, fatigue, and body aches.\n\nCutaneous Infection\nTransmitted when the bacteria enters the body through broken skin. \n\nSymptoms can include. Small itchy blisters or bumps, swelling around the sores, painless skin ulcers with a black center that appears after the blisters."

Around 10% will experience some combination of vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, bloating, indigestion, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite.\n\n(Word of warning: the age-old adage of �rubbing dirt in it� will not only make the condition worse but also force my eyes to roll out of their sockets during the follow-up amputation. - Cassandra)"

msgid "Black plague refers to a form of plague called bubonic plague. It�s one of three types of plague caused by the Yersinia pestis bacteria, whose life cycle is usually centered around rodents and their fleas. Bubonic plague is contracted by human patients after being bitten by an infected flea, usually following a drop in rodent population forcing the fleas to feed on humans. The bacteria then multiply within a lymph node near the original bite, causing it to become swollen and painful. These are called buboes, hence the name bubonic.\n\nPatients then rapidly develop a fever, headaches, chills, and weakness. If they are not treated with antibiotics, the bacteria will spread throughout the patient�s bloodstream. This leads to septic shock, multiple organ failures, and death. Yersinia pestis bacteria have various mechanisms to either hide from or fight off the body�s defenses, so the patient�s immune system will provide minimal help in fighting off the infection.\n\n(Expect your people to be all-around more useless at their jobs while infected. Consider giving them some days off to die in peace if treatment isn�t available. - Cassandra)\n\nYersinia pestis bacteria has been found to be present in the commonwealth�s molerat population. Care should be taken when encountering these creatures, alive or dead. It is recommended to wear protective clothing while hunting or butchering them. (eg: gloves or hazmat.)\n\n(If one is determined to go molerat hunting and has the resources, power armor is a one-stop solution. Like with most problems in the wastes. - Cassandra)\n\nThe introduction of pet shops to the Commonwealth may introduce the risk of pets carrying infected fleas. A flea treatment program would be advisable should this trend continue.\n\n(Veterinary sciences are a little more scarce since the bombs fell.

Vivisection of several subjects suggests that molerats do not suffer adversely from an infestation and that their digestive system is improved by the worm�s presence.\n\nWhen bone worms infect a human�s digestive system, they release a toxin that causes illness in the host. Firstly, the host�s body attempts to remove the infection with an emetic reaction. Then the worm�s toxin begins to attack nerve cells causing mild pain signals. These are perceived as a deep, body-wide prickling sensation, that is described as �itching bones�. The itching sensation and the worm�s bone-white color led to the folk legend that these parasites feed on the host�s skeleton. A hypothesis that we have found no medical evidence to support.\n\nThe symptoms are relatively minor, but the persistence of the bone-eating myth inflates the fear that surrounds this infection. The unique �bone itching� symptom is an obvious marker for diagnosis. Confirmation of infection can be made via inspection of a stool sample for the worm�s small white eggs and occasional adult worm."

Unusually, the chemical process of the bacteria�s reproduction also results in radioluminescence. Patients will usually develop other symptoms such as fever, headaches, chills, and fatigue. It can make people very ill and if left untreated, may result in death. A healthy immune system has a fighting chance against it.\n\n(The visible symptoms of this disease elicit a particular kind of conditioned response in the wastelander population: If it glows, stay away. It overrides even the �ooh, shiny� instinct. - Cassandra)\n\nCare should be taken when encountering the preferred host creatures. Individuals handling their carcasses to gather meat and hides will be at risk of infected flea bites. The introduction of pet shops to the Commonwealth may also introduce the risk of pets carrying infected fleas."

The specific organism is a previously unrecorded amoeba that we�re classifying as amoeba novicius.\n\nAmoeba novicius is commonly found in unpurified water and blood bugs. When the protozoa get into a human digestive system, they grip the intestinal walls and begin feeding on various bacteria found there. Once established, they multiply quickly. The body�s defenses attempt to get rid of the infection by evacuating the digestive system resulting in abdominal pain, nausea, sickness, and diarrhea. \n\nPatients often also report unusually strong impulses to keep eating, despite their illness. After further research, we have discovered that the amoeba novicius releases a hormone that mimics ghrelin (a.k.a. the �hunger hormone�) which stimulates appetite and increases food intake.\n\n(Would you believe that most people in the wasteland don�t notice that their hunger might be abnormal? - Cassandra)\n\nSome of the amoebas will be passed through the digestive system.

Transmission occurs when saliva from an infected subject gets into an individual�s body and the virus reaches their central nervous system.\n\nWhile rabies lyssavirus probably originated in bats, it is most commonly found in dogs. Historical records show that it can potentially infect a large number of other mammal species, and potentially even some birds and reptiles. \n\nA patient who contracts rabies will begin to have symptoms such as a high temperature, headaches, anxiety, and generally feeling unwell. As the virus spreads, the patient will become increasingly confused, suffer hallucinations (both auditory and visual), produce excessive saliva (causing frothing of the mouth), muscle spasms, and paralysis. Unless the patient receives effective treatment it will likely prove fatal.\n\nA quick diagnosis of rabies is vital for ensuring a good outcome from any treatment. This can be complicated by the initial symptoms being easily mistaken for influenza or other minor viral infections. Ideally, potential sufferers should be identified before they begin to exhibit symptoms. This might be achieved by identifying anyone with bite injuries from an infected animal and providing immediate preventative treatment.\n\nConsideration will need to be given to ensuring that animals within our own communities (both working and pets) are not exposed to rabies.

They infest an individual�s digestive tracts and once they become fully grown, begin to emit low-level radiation. This causes symptoms of stomach ache, sickness, diarrhea, cold clammy skin, and confusion.  \n\nRad worms are most commonly contracted from consuming food or drink connected to locations inhabited by feral ghouls. Patients with rad worms can pass them onto others by failing to clean their hands after using the toilet, and contaminating surfaces and consumables.\n\nDiagnosis is confirmed with a patient�s stool sample. In the early stages, the worms and their eggs can be visible under a microscope, and at later stages, it�s enough to observe the stool in the dark for any glow. In particularly advanced cases it�s sometimes possible to detect a visible glow around the abdomen."

The resemblance of symptoms has led to it being named after the colloquial term for post-traumatic stress disorder. It is also frequently observed after close encounters with deathclaws and other feral fauna and can be misdiagnosed as PTSD based on context.\n\nCloser examination indicates that this condition is caused by a mutated viral infection with a mechanism of action similar to that of rabies. It is asymptomatic in animals other than humans and is transmitted through wounds inflicted by the teeth or claws of the infected creature. It does not appear to be transmittable between humans.\n\nOther symptoms include nausea, cramping, migraines, vertigo, anxiety, depression, arrhythmia, and brief loss of consciousness. The severity of the symptoms is frequently exacerbated by post-traumatic stress from the encounter with a carrier."
