msgctxt "[05005C1D]"

msgctxt "[050151F3]"

msgctxt "[05015187]"

msgctxt "[05015282]"

msgid "But once the attack was over, and Id left... God. Its been some time since Id felt shame that bad."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501522F]"
msgid "So when LaMont captured me, and gave me the ultimatum of infiltrating your group, or facing a firing squad, it was an easy choice."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501522F]"
msgid "Id get her all the intel she wanted. As long as it meant -you- got your comeuppance. Algernon was an honorable man. And he deserved to be avenged."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501517C]"
msgid "Heh, not as much as I wanted. LaMont was insistent that I keep my Intel gathering as low-key as possible. Avoid tipping you off for as long as I could."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501517C]"
msgid "Mostly it was just stuff like - whos working for you, number of troops, settlements defenses, any tech you find, that kinda thing."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501517C]"
msgid "But looks like someone finally noticed what I was doing. Mustve been when I made contact - to tell LaMont about your little attack plan on Quincy."

msgctxt "[0501517C]"
msgid "I bet it was your Salvador... They say dont bullshit a bullshitter. And that guy... heh! Well, Id say hes hiding a lot more than -I- ever have..."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015185]"
msgid "Well, Id sure like to finish you off myself, but, we both know thats not gonna happen. So, fingers crossed LaMont does the job instead."

msgctxt "[05015185]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015265]"

msgctxt "[05015265]"

msgctxt "[0501514F]"
msgid "Hmph. Not that I had much of a choice ...So, what now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501526A]"
msgid "Guess Ill drop the charade... I admit, I joined your group under false pretenses. All so I could pass along intel to LaMont."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050151FC]"
msgid "Is that really why you lied to me?"
msgstr "그게 정말 나한테 구라쳤던 이유인 거예요?"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015136]"

msgctxt "[05015273]"
msgid "I believe you. Thanks."

msgctxt "[050151F8]"
msgid "Look, its like this. During my bid to exit the Commonwealth, I was captured by the Gunners and taken to LaMont."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050151F8]"
msgid "I was given a choice. Either infiltrate your group and provide intel, or take my chances with a blindfold and a firing squad."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050151F8]"
msgid "I accepted LaMonts terms, but I never had any intention of giving her what she wanted. Instead, Ive been sending the Gunners disinformation."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050151F8]"
msgid "Ive been exaggerating things like your settlement defenses, troop numbers, or your awareness of Gunner movements."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050151F8]"
msgid "My aim was to exploit the fog of war as much as possible, disorient the Gunners, and give you as much of an edge as I could."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015149]"
msgid "I doubt Im the only person on the Gunners information payroll. As such, it was best if I kept my head down, and appeared to be playing along."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015149]"
msgid "I knew youd find out at some point! But I didnt expect it to be at -this- particular moment... The timing isnt exactly ideal..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015149]"
msgid "I mustve been careless during my last communication, dropped too many breadcrumbs... You see, LaMont wanted intel on your troop numbers."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015149]"
msgid "I assured her that you barely had any soldiers, that shed only need a nominal force to hold Quincy. Oops-a-daisy. I guess that was a lie..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015278]"
msgid "I get it. Boy who cried wolf. I understand, really I do! But Im telling you! Im on your side!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015279]"
msgid "Alright! Im not going to push the issue... Ill go."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015279]"
msgid "And dont worry, Im not gonna offer any parting advice, or anything. After all, my credibilitys at an all-time low."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015279]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015231]"
msgid "Ah, good. Thats a relief to hear! I appreciate the trust."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015231]"
msgid "Anyway, enough about me, more about that nuke on the other side of this wall..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015124]"
msgid "When you met with Algernon, you -couldve- killed him. But you didnt. And I was grateful for that... I... I just wanted to help you..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015221]"
msgid "But, its not what you think! Yeah, I -have- been feeding LaMont info on you. But its all been false intel! I swear!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050151BC]"
msgid "What have you been up to?"
msgstr "그런데 당신은 지금까지 뭘 하고 있던 거죠?"

msgctxt "[050151AA]"

msgctxt "[05015153]"

msgctxt "[05015284]"
msgid "I dont like being lied to."
msgstr "거짓말 듣고 싶지는 않아."

msgctxt "[05015233]"
msgid "Entering Quincy undetected was childs play. LaMonts leadership -- hasnt changed the Gunners security practices much..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015233]"
msgid "After that, I swiped a technicians uniform, tagged and unlocked storage areas with gear our people could use, and took care of any guards inside..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015233]"
msgid "Then, after overhearing of the Gunners nuclear ambitions, I made my way here, and began devising a strategy to counter their efforts."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050151A4]"
msgid "From what Ive been able to find out, the Gunners hauled in a nuke all the way from Province Bay."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050151A4]"
msgid "Probably the same type as what they tried to drop on HQ. My guess is that theyre rigging it to blow once they have that tape thing theyre after."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050151D6]"
msgid "Right you are."
msgstr "물론이지."

msgctxt "[050151C4]"
msgid "Ah. Right. I was wondering when you might catch on to that..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501516E]"
msgid "The Gunners are busy setting up a nuke, but if we act fast, I think we can stop them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015276]"
msgid "I was just about to radio you, let you know the situation here. But given your presence, seems youre already in the loop."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501520A]"
msgid "Ah, there you are."
msgstr "아 거기 있군요."

msgctxt "[05014EEA]"
msgid "Now the question is... What are we meant to do here?..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EE9]"
msgid "Lets see if we cant figure out whats going on here..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EE8]"
msgid "Well, this sure looks like a reactor room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EE6]"
msgid "Im no technician, but Id say this is where were meant to be."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EE2]"
msgid "Try that keycard on the door."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EE3]"
msgid "Theres gotta be a key somewhere."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EE4]"
msgid "We got a Gunner down here!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EE5]"
msgid "Huh... Smart thinking. Should lighten our workload."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EF6]"
msgid "And... there we are! One terminal, hacked for your convenience. Feel free to take a look."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EF8]"
msgid "No problem. Let me take a poke at it..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EFB]"
msgid "Then lets stop wasting time and start moving."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EF9]"
msgid "Gunner bots! Lets take em down!"

msgctxt "[05014EFC]"

msgctxt "[05014EFA]"
msgid "Hey, nice job! Found us a shortcut, huh?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EF7]"
msgid "Well find another way through. Lets go."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EF5]"
msgid "Oh, its alright. We can find another way to the reactor room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EEB]"
msgid "Okay, were in."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EEB]"
msgid "We should keep moving forward. Theres gotta be some kinda... control room or something, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EEB]"
msgid "Heres hoping our objective - is as simple as hitting a big button..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EF2]"
msgid "But once were in there, what weve got to do here - might become clear."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EF0]"
msgid "We should make our way to the main reactor room."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05014EEF]"
msgid "Were in. What now?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050151A7]"
msgid "Since Ive now a direct link to your Pip-Boy, Ill be able to guide you. So, enough gabbing, and let us make haste to the Radio Tower!"

msgid "Ugh, fine. But I have no intention of staying down here for the entire battle. Ill rendezvous with you as soon as Im able."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015281]"
msgid "Nonsense! Its simple. Just monitor the coolant levels and replenish them if a reactor starts overheating."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501516B]"
msgid "What?! But I dont know how to do any of this tech stuff!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050151C0]"

msgctxt "[0501511E]"

msgctxt "[05015196]"

msgctxt "[05015288]"
msgid "Simply put, we will be sending Vault-Tec multiple data bursts, not dissimilar to the one I sent the Comm Array."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015288]"
msgid "This will disrupt their communications, possibly even crashing their comm system, -if- were lucky."

msgctxt "[05015173]"

msgctxt "[050151CE]"

msgid "This broadcast will completely disrupt Vault-Tecs communications. No more contact with the Gunners. No more eavesdropping!"

msgctxt "[0500A83F]"
msgid "Let me guess..."

msgctxt "[0500A82D]"
msgid "The Garden of Eden Creation Kit. A device not dissimilar to an original ASAM in its application."

msgctxt "[0500A82D]"

msgctxt "[0500A8EA]"

msgctxt "[0500A8EB]"

msgctxt "[0500A86C]"
msgid "Now as youre both aware, ASAMs enable even the mentally deficient to construct fairly elaborate structures with great proficiency."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A86C]"

msgctxt "[0500A86C]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8E1]"
msgid "Prior to the bombs falling, Atomic Rain was controlled by a system known as ECAM."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8E1]"
msgid "At its core, ECAM was just a large room of networked computers -- constantly communicating with the satellites it monitored, and occasionally issuing commands."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8E1]"

msgctxt "[0500A8B6]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A80A]"
msgid "What, like a -- supercomputer? No problem! Ive got a few ASAMs with me. Just send over some blueprints and we start construction right away!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8F2]"
msgid "Your summation of the plan is correct, -if- a tad nebulous. We shall indeed hijack the Atomic Rain satellites."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8F2]"
msgid "But in order to do so -- we must establish a connection to the satellite network. And for that, well have to replicate a pre-war mainframe."

msgctxt "[0500A803]"

msgctxt "[0500A84B]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8E9]"

msgctxt "[0500A856]"

msgctxt "[0500A868]"
msgid "Here we go..."

msgctxt "[0500A869]"
msgid "So, this is Vault 111. Looks in pretty good condition. All things considered."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A838]"
msgid "Before the bombs fell, I hid a holotape containing the original schematics for a number of my inventions down here. Including the ASAMs."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A838]"
msgid "Thats what youll be looking for. This holotape."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A879]"
msgid "Ah, small problem, Doc. Looks like the Vaults security has kicked in, its sealed the way."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8D5]"
msgid "Hmmm... If youre where I think you are, you should see a fire control unit near a doorway."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A805]"
msgid "Ahh... Yeah! We see it."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A84D]"
msgid "Block the intake near the bottom. Itll trick the Vault into thinking a fire has broken out. Should open the Overseers emergency escape."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A893]"
msgid "Bingo! That did the trick. But wait... If there was a fire, shouldnt the door have remained closed?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A915]"
msgid "Yes, it should of. But Vault-Tec were never big on fixing design oversights. Thats why they resorted to bringing in people like -me-."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A81B]"
msgid "Well, okay then. Were heading in."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A854]"
msgid "So, Dr. Magnusson. You worked on Vault 111?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8C4]"
msgid "In a manner of speaking. You see Vault-Tec were struggling to achieve successful cryogenic suspension."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8C4]"
msgid "Test subjects were being prematurely thawed out. Resulting in tissue damage, and cellular bonding with the consistency of runny oatmeal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8C4]"
msgid "I have a background in the field of cryogenics, so I offered my expertise in exchange for supplies -- and the funding for my pet project."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A810]"
msgid "This isnt the first time youve mentioned this project of yours. Would it be out of line if I asked what it was?.."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A83A]"
msgid "Yes, it would."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A885]"
msgid "Ah, damn it. We got another sealed door. And I dont think the fire control trick is going to work again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8E8]"
msgid "Youre in the Overseers office, yes? You should be able to override the door controls from in there. Take a look around."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A88B]"
msgid "Hey! You got the door open. Good job!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A850]"
msgid "Alright Doctor, I wont ask about your project again."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A850]"
msgid "But I would like to know why youd hide your invention schematics down here, and not someplace else. There mustve been a reason?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A824]"
msgid "Hm. I can respect a curious mind. Ill answer that query."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A824]"
msgid "It wasnt only that holotape I planned to hide down here, but myself also. I reserved the use of a cryo-chamber. Part of my payment from Vault-Tec."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A85B]"
msgid "You were gonna freeze yourself? Down here?! Why?.."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8B5]"
msgid "I had set plans in motion that would take some time. Until said plans had seen fruition -- there seemed little point remaining conscious."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A800]"
msgid "But, you never made it to the Vault. Did you run out of time to make it down here, or?.."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A84C]"
msgid "No. I chose not to come. ...I discovered Vault-Tec never intended for me -- or anyone else to leave Vault 111. We were -all- to stay on ice, permanently."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A881]"
msgid "Dang it! Another sealed door."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8C3]"
msgid "Hold on, let me take a look at this..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A80F]"
msgid "Hmm... I reckon I can get this one open. We just need a small fluctuation of power to trip this circuit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A846]"
msgid "Look around for something close by that could do that. A small power surge will do."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8CE]"
msgid "That did it! Doors open."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A808]"
msgid "Hey, Doctor? I got another question for you."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A833]"
msgid "Why does that not surprise me?.."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A872]"
msgid "Why are you helping us?.. Fighting back against the Gunners, I mean."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8CD]"
msgid "You know the Gunners have an employer, yes? But do you know what it is theyve been employed to do -- all this time?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A801]"
msgid "Uh, cant say that we do..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A859]"
msgid "To the best of my knowledge, the Gunners contracted responsibilities are two-fold. One. Locate and secure components of a particular pre-war technology."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A859]"
msgid "And two. Devise a way to deliver said technology to their employer."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A859]"
msgid "The late Captain Wes had already fulfilled the second part of the contract. And this new Captain LaMont, is very close to completing the first."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A88F]"
msgid "But whats that got to do with-"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A913]"
msgid "This technology theyve been searching for, theyre called Engramtapes. And along with the ASAMs, they were a core part of my project."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A832]"
msgid "So thats why youre helping us. The Gunners are messing around with something that was important to you. Its personal."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A86D]"
msgid "Hm, my boy. This goes far beyond personal..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8B1]"
msgid "Hey, were seeing a bunch of those pods. Think were in the right room. What now?.."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A916]"
msgid "Find and open my cryo-chamber."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A825]"
msgid "Um, okay... How do we know which one is yours?.."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A855]"
msgid "Itll be the chamber that Im -not- in."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A88A]"
msgid "...Right!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8D0]"
msgid "Oh... Is that your?.. I-Im sorry! I didnt even think-"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A80E]"
msgid "...Take as much time as you need. Ill just be over here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A847]"
msgid "This one is empty, assuming this pod wasnt yours, this must be the right one. Go ahead, open it up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050156D8]"
msgid "Go ahead. Open the pod."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501921F]"

msgctxt "[0500A831]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A83C]"

msgctxt "[0500A821]"

msgctxt "[0500A8C9]"
msgid "No, Ill hold onto it for now."
msgstr "아니요, 지금 당장은 제가 가지고 있겠어요."

msgctxt "[0500A7FB]"
msgid "What do you need it for?"
msgstr "그건 어디에 쓰려는 건데요?"

msgctxt "[0500A80B]"
msgid "Check the rifles coil assembly, youll notice a small control board. Pull out the gold colored chip. Dont worry, its designed to be removed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A802]"
msgid "Will you two quit screwing around?! I swear, youre worse than first year lab techs..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A844]"
msgid "Wow... thats one tiny chip. Hang on, Ill need to find the right tool for this... Feel free to chat amongst yourselves!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A828]"
msgid "Most of my creations are designed around proprietary software -- or hardware, like that chip."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A828]"
msgid "Primarily, this was because -I- could fabricate more sophisticated components than were commercially available. Or privately, for that matter..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A828]"
msgid "But an added benefit of this, is that my inventions and work became difficult for others to decipher, interfere with, or replicate."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A828]"
msgid "This acted as a safeguard of sorts. And it allowed me to use certain components as physical encryption."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8B8]"
msgid "For now, its... better that you dont know. Trust me. The knowledge would only cause complications."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8B9]"
msgid "No. At least... not now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8BA]"
msgid "*sigh* Very well. We can discuss it later. But now is not the time."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A896]"
msgid "Despite their crude design, dubious purpose, and shocking lack of redundant backups..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A896]"
msgid "Once I had finished overhauling them, this Vaults cryo-chambers offered the perfect respite."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A896]"
msgid "When the bombs fell, I was already in my mid 50s. And it would take at least two decades for my preparations to bear fruit."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A896]"
msgid "Freezing myself seemed like the obvious choice. Of course, in the end, I ended up not using the cryo-chamber. Best laid plans, as the saying goes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A861]"
msgid "Part of Vault-Tecs Project Safehouse."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A861]"
msgid "It was sold to the public as a shelter, meant to protect and house individuals in the event of atomic war."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A861]"
msgid "But in truth, 111s purpose was to study -- the prolonged effects of cryogenic suspension."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A861]"
msgid "Something that Vault-Tecs higher ups were -very- interested to know the results of."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8C1]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A891]"
msgid "Precisely. And -this- key will open the way to where I hid the holotape. Youll find its accompanying lock on the inner section of my cryo-chamber."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A80D]"
msgid "Woah now!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500A8E6]"
msgid "I sealed off and concealed an old maintenance tunnel. The only way to find it -- was if you knew it was there. And if you had the key, of course."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0500F37D]"

msgctxt "[05013D3E]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05013D34]"

msgctxt "[05013CF9]"

msgid "Left alone, theyll heal in time, but time is a luxury even under the best of circumstances."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05013CF9]"
msgid "Most of the injured are in bad enough condition that they cant be transported to HQ. Theyll have to get treatment and recover at their Outposts."

msgctxt "[05013CF9]"
msgid "By your leave, I can take a trip out and take care of the wounded this time around."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05013CF9]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05013CF9]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05013D17]"

msgctxt "[0501329F]"
msgid "Alternatively, you could always try scanning samples directly - using the Vit-o-Matic. Specimens need not be living, but ideally should be preserved."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05013294]"

msgid "You paying attention? ...Anyway, those are all the Roles for the attack."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050134D8]"

msgid "The importance of Air Support CANNOT be ignored!! The skies can be a powerful friend..."

msgctxt "[0501351F]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05013565]"
msgid "Additionally, we discussed the use of Infiltration - a team of specialists who could unlock doors, hack terminals, allowing for easier passage."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050134F6]"
msgid "Not to mention, the possibility of Artillery. Ranged attacks on incoming Gunners would thin their numbers. Reducing reinforcements."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050134C0]"
msgid "Such as, disrupting or sabotaging the Gunners tech. It would sure make the fight a lot easier! That is, providing we have some dedicated Technicians."

msgid "Making use of dedicated Technicians, to disable or even sabotage some of the Gunners technology."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05013514]"
msgid "What about that second part to this plan? You said something about mitigation?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050134CE]"
msgid "After that, our focus shifts to eliminating any Gunners remaining in Quincy and finding Magnussons lab before any more show up."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050134ED]"
msgid "Thatll be the Defense Team. Theyll stop any Gunners from reaching the HQ, and secure the route to Quincy, ensuring a steady flow of our troops can enter."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050134AE]"
msgid "With the Strike Team preoccupying the Gunners, a second team will cut a path from the HQ - to Quincys main entrance."

msgctxt "[050155C8]"
msgid "But when our hails met with silence, our desperation grew. Finally, a glimmer of hope! We got a response from a Vault -- from a mercenary named Wes."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050155C8]"
msgid "And so, without fully comprehending their ruthless nature, we enlisted his groups services. Only after they recovered the first tape did we realize our mistake..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050155C8]"
msgid "But, it was too late. The Gunners now held a powerful bargaining chip. We were essentially handcuffed to our contract."

msgctxt "[050155CF]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015607]"
msgid "Why didnt he disclose to you -- that he wasnt the -real- Magnusson, but in fact, a technological copy? Ill tell you why..."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015607]"
msgid "Because at the time, revealing these things didnt align with his agenda. That being, the destruction of Vault-Tec."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015607]"
msgid "Im genuinely sorry to say, that Magnusson has been using you as a pawn."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015625]"
msgid "And despite our agreement to provide him ongoing funding, Magnusson stole from us, and undermined Vault-Tec at every opportunity."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015625]"
msgid "Astonishingly, he now blames us for occupying what he still regards as -his- property, overlooking the fact that -we- possess legal ownership."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015625]"
msgid "Therefore, I can only conclude that Magnusson wanted to conceal the truth, so he could keep using you as a tool -- to harm Vault-Tec."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501560F]"
msgid "In order to pass the long years, many of our high-ranking staff -- opted for extended periods of cryogenic suspension."
msgstr ""

msgid "If you expect me to believe you, I want proof."
msgstr "그 말을 믿으라고? 증거를 보여줘."

msgctxt "[0501562B]"
msgid "Obviously to stop -us- from talking. Magnussons held a grudge against Vault-Tec -- ever since we acquired his research from RobCo."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015601]"
msgid "You might find the answer to -that- underwhelming. We never anticipated our tenure at Luna Colony -- to span more than a couple of decades."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015601]"
msgid "But after Magnusson ensured the loss of the Engramtapes, we were forced to resort to some... creative measures to ensure our survival."

msgctxt "[05015604]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015606]"
msgid "Naturally. I wouldnt make claims without evidence."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05015616]"

msgctxt "[050155CE]"

msgid "It began syncing to the ASAMs -we- have here. While I could be wrong, I believe that -was- the Arrays original purpose."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05018166]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050181B5]"
msgid "I see where thatd work for normal settlements, but how about... you know, Raiders and such? Theyd just take it by force."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05018211]"

msgctxt "[0501815B]"
msgid "Well - I mean, there was a bit more to it, but... yeah, in essence. Water makes or breaks a community, I suppose."

msgctxt "[050181A4]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050181AE]"
msgid "What about the Slavers? Why do you remember them?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05018200]"
msgid "Only reason I remember the Raiders is cause they sewed circuit boards into their armor like decorations. The idiots looked dumb as hell."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05018133]"
msgid "Well, me and my mercs were the ones to kick out the previous squatters. Slavers were using the mine to keep their stock, and the factories were bases to some Raider gangs."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050181C3]"
msgid "Dare I ask why you actually knew that off the top of your head?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501820B]"
msgid "How should I know - oh, wait, I do actually know. Its from a pre-war mine and a chain of electronics factories."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05018154]"
msgid "Where the hell did the NLTC manage to find this much gold and copper? That last shipment is unbelievable."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050181A2]"
msgid "Oh. Guess that does actually make sense. Though Im still not gonna take that as a compliment."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050181F9]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501814A]"
msgid "Didnt put any of those words in your mouth, yet here you are, getting all defensive about it. Dont take it personally - I dont trust anyone motivated by altruism."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05018215]"

msgid "What can I say, Im a girl with expensive taste and their caps buy me the shiniest toys. Nothing deep about that."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[050181B7]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0501817F]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[05018123]"
