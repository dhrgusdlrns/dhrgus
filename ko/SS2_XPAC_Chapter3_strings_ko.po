This has caused us considerable concern.\n\nRest assured that here at Vault-Tec, we recognize that 200 years can bring about a multitude of unforeseen changes and events, including, but not limited to:\n\n1. Difficulties or setbacks in Vault research projects.\n2. Transitions in Vault leadership or community structure.\n3. Disregard for Vault-Tec guiding principles.\n4. Departure and repopulation of the Vault by external groups.\n5. Unwarranted skepticism towards Vault-Tec.\n6. Manipulation by outside entities.\n7. Ill-advised adoption of Communist ideals.\n\nWe wish to reassure you that we recognize and accept such changes as natural developments, and will not hold you or your Vault residents liable, providing you promptly reestablish contact with us without delay.\n\nThank you once again, and we look forward to your swift response. Remember, a brilliant tomorrow is forged today, with Vault-Tec!"
