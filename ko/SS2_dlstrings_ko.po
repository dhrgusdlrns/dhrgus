Nor do many of us forget the troubles of yesteryear, when this beloved beverage was better known for its more sinister side. \n\nRegardless, new sources of Nuka Cola means new sources of caps, important as those long in circulation begin to wear. However, this reporter would caution that an influx in new caps may also present a tempting opportunity for counterfeiters to try to slip some home-minted blanks in with the bunch.

The ship announced itself with the following message, broadcast from speakers on the ship; \"People of the Commonwealth, do not interfere. Our intentions are peaceful. We are the Brotherhood of Steel.\"\n\nThe airship appears similar to a prewar zeppelin, though observers claim it was likely built recently. It shows no signs of two centuries of decay as a restored model would, and few of the design elements match images found in the Boston Public Library ruins.\n\nThe airship stopped over Boston Airport, where the Brotherhood of Steel (BoS) has constructed facilities and defenses, though their purpose remains unknown. Since its arrival, BoS has made no further attempts to communicate. \n\nThough no incidents have been reported, citizens are advised to avoid interfering with BoS patrols. Squads can be seen airborne or on foot, and are heavily armed and armored. BoS operators often skirmish with Gunners and Raiders, but have shown no aggression toward citizens.</font></p>"

To think the Brotherhood sent me for tech recovery when there is a world of beer out here!

You've made a great choice by purchasing this book and are clearly well on your way to becoming a world-class Brewmaster!</font>\n<font face='$HandwrittenFont' size='14'>Where is the device to brew with? It must be in here somewhere. Nope, nada, not here. I might need to look around in here. Found it.

I am taking notes since I will need to recreate it on the road. </font>\n<font face='$ConsoleFont' size='18'>\nIn this book, you'll learn about:\n\nCreating Mash - the Mash is the base of every beer, and the type of base you use, determines what kind of beers you can create.</font> <font face='$HandwrittenFont' size='14'>Looks easy enough , I just boil some razor grain or the like and it turns into this soupy stuff - so far so good!</font><font face='$ConsoleFont' size='18'>\n\nWort Boiling - You don't want to be drinking brown chunky soup do you? Of course not!</font> <font face='$HandwrittenFont' size='14'>I don't know how boiling gets the junk out, but it does seem to be important for the \"Hopping\" (whatever the hell that is..). Oh for the love of the Bard! I need a library. Ah well, such as it is. So far, running this stuff through some old socks has been as good as anything for getting the chunks out. My feet are however, quite chilled.</font><font face='$ConsoleFont' size='18'>\n\nBitterness Hopping - Without bitterness, you may as well be drinking Nuka Cola - you're not an infant, you want a man's beverage!</font> <font face='$HandwrittenFont' size='14'>I found some old bags of stuff labeled hops at Beantown, but they're all dust now... quite the harrowing experience that was! Tarberries are pretty bitter, maybe those will work... Wild Tarberries are more bitter than the others.</font><font face='$ConsoleFont' size='18'>\n\nFlavor Hopping - You want your beer to be crisp and refreshing - this is how you do it!</font><font face='$HandwrittenFont' size='14'>So apparently there were multiple types of these \"Hops\", maybe it was just an easier word for ingredients - that makes sense. Alas for us humble players, the fools did go and destroy almost everything in the third act, the world is shambles- So now I'm thinking we just toss some food in there to change the way the beer tastes.</font><font face='$ConsoleFont' size='18'>\n\nAroma Hopping - The final touch to give your beer a pleasant scent - your nose will be buried in a glass after all!</font> <font face='$HandwrittenFont' size='14'>So just something that smells good - seems easy enough. Chems have some pretty interesting smells, those might work. Hell, even bloodleaf and hubflowers smell kinda nice...\n\nI'm going to have to start writing down whenever I find a good combination that tastes right, there's so much stuff to work with. Note to self: If you didn't write a hop down, it just means to throw in whatever cheap extra stuff you've got lying around.</font></p>"

Theodore Collins, who owned and operated the cannery, was recently found dead in his factory, following what appears to have been a bloody shoot-out. The identity of the attacker or attackers remains unknown, but given the recent outbreak of people getting sick from eating the cannery's potted meats, it is considered highly likely that he was killed by an angry former customer.\n\nWhat is more unsettling, however, is what an investigation of the factory revealed. In the basement of the cannery, several feral ghouls - both living and dead - were found. A close inspection of the cannery equipment reveals that these ghouls may have been used as ingredients in Mr. Collins' canned meats. Readers are urged to destroy any cans in their possession, and seek medical attention immediately.\n</font></p>"

While Mr. Collins states that he is deeply sorry for the recent controversy regarding his product, he remains firm in stating that he does not believe that the incidents of illness were a result of the canning process. Nevertheless, he promises that Longneck Lukowski's Cannery will take greater care in selecting ingredients moving forward, and will be experimenting with new meat blends to try and minimize the risk of a bad reaction from customers, moving forward. To aid in this endeavor, Mr. Collins is proud to announce that he has taken on a new business partner, who will be directly responsible for addressing all quality concerns.\n</font></p>"

This is unfortunate news, given the rise in popularity Lukowski's meats have seen since the cannery's reactivation.

Being the last living descendant of her family line, it seems she refuses to let the Island have its way.\n\nAn unusual tale indeed, and it seems not the first time it has been told. Recovered evidence seems to reveal that the latest Mainlander was preceded by another of a similar background, who failed the final of three revenge stories as told by Carrie Dalton. Certainly one can't believe that begrudged creatures are capable of resurrection when their slayer has been defeated, so what is the truth, if any?\n\nAlthough Carrie refuses to comment on past events, perhaps one can believe it to be some sort of test to prove one's worth. Or perhaps, considering numerous unexplained events, the Fog makes its own truth near Far Harbor.\n\n</font></p>"

Upon realizing both their worth and collector's value of the so-called \"Pelman's\", the mercenary sold them and Machete Mike went off to complete his own project.

Curiously, there seems to be no obvious evidence of purposefully removed hull apart from the obvious corrosion, with plenty of salvage opportunity still available, unless the Trappers chose to recapture the locale.\n\nDespite this, strips of solid metal now protect the more vital points of defense preventing the ramparts from being easily destroyed during an attack and ensuring the security of the people within.\n\n</font></p>"

Perhaps with similar thoughts in mind, the Mariner hired her reliable mercenary one last time to obtain resources capable of withstanding such a barrage of corrosion - the carapaces of the Island's hardier variant of Mirelurks.\n\nThe finishing touches for the fortifications allow the spiked barriers to withstand acid attacks and give those standing on the ramparts capable of withstanding such a barrage with a slightly more limited line of fire. The residents of Far Harbor should certainly be thankful for having a landowner so thoughtful and caring to consider every conceivable situation that would endanger them and commit herself to their preservation.\n\n</font></p>"

Radiation - in extremely simple terms - is both the by-product and the cause of more \"complex\" atoms breaking apart, creating new, \"simpler\" atoms. Therefore, exposure to radiation creates more universes, to which the Children dedicate their cause.\n\nSometimes one of the faithful can lose their way and attempt to find their own answers, fleeing for what might be considered sacrilege.

Whether it becomes a popular drink in the Commonwealth remains to be seen as it is considered less sweet and more bitter compared to the widespread Nuka Cola.\n\nInterestingly, an unusual property of the soda pop is that it retains absolutely no radiation despite exposure - for recovered bottles - and irradiated produce - for newer ones. It is currently unclear how this occurs during the carbonation process, but it is by no means an unwelcome exception in a world permeated by irradiated food and drink.\n\nThose who wish to try out the fishy Tester variant are advised that others might not appreciate your choices due to the odd effect of the drink affecting the imbiber's sweat, so try not to be insulted by statements that you stink of fish and warn your friends in advance.\n\n</font></p>"

Considering that their primary recruiting method involves actively poisoning potential members, nonconsensual irradiating of non-members, demanding unthinking obedience and proof of loyalty via cold-blooded murder of their current members, my conclusion is thus - Atom can shove it.

The name of this monster is the Shipbreaker, a particularly nasty Fog Crawler.\n\nWhilst little is known about this creature, the name gives a fairly obvious hint towards its reputation. As to how it is capable of emitting its own radio signal, one could argue that it is capable of emitting a growl or rumble at an almost paranormal frequency that is comparable to radio waves. A much simpler explanation is that it swallowed a pre-war short-range radio transmitter, presumably from one of those ships it had destroyed.\n\nFor anyone foolhardy enough to consider tracking this beast, extreme caution is advised due to the supposed power it possesses.

Many of us have lived through such life-shattering events that it can be difficult or even nearly impossible to enjoy our waking moments. This writer is unable to sleep without a gun in their hands because of what happened in their past. Others perhaps are frightened of their own dreams and shamble around, terrified of when their exhaustion hits its peak.\n\nBut would removing that memory truly be the answer? Without the memories of fear and pain alongside happiness, one cannot embrace the building blocks of our character and become a better person for it. With this, another appropriate saying comes to mind: \"those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\".\n\n</font></p>"

Primary exports include unique flora and fauna, high volumes of fish and aquatic-based meat, as well as reliable and improvised weaponry. If nothing else, popular soda brand Vim! is available for purchase for those looking for a soft drink that isn't a Nuka-Cola brand.\n\n</font></p>"

The water should be avoided due to the raised temperatures, and air filters are recommended to avoid inhaling the thick smoke.\n\nIt appears that the ship was carrying expensive computer hardware for the residents of Acadia, who were looking to upgrade their equipment and expand their digital storage space. The cause of the crash is as of yet undetermined. It is also unclear as to why so much is needed as visitors to Acadia will notice the large number of computer terminals, each with their own storage bank.

Whilst not actively engaging, they do still believe that the Fog will eventually take the entire Island \"as is Atom's will\".\n\nSome rumors have been circulating that Acadia is responsible for this relief of tension, particularly as Synths are more than capable of infiltrating communities. Whilst no evidence has been found proving these claims, one has to admit it is rather odd and might even cause those wanting all Synths to be free to have doubts - if even the Synths change themselves to manipulate people, is the Institute really so bad in trying to keep them from running amok?

With only two gangs to keep from each other's throats, they are more focused than ever in coordinating their efforts to bleed the Commonwealth dry.

Whether this will follow the old Vault-Tec's doctrine of experimentation on its inhabitants, or a new underground city dedicated to the benefit of all, remains to be seen.

It's a wonder that the main area doesn't collapse, although future architects for the location should absolutely not tempt fate by not building structural pylons.\n\nUntil the area has been properly explored to its fullest, explorers should remain on alert as it is highly likely that creatures from the Wasteland have settled the numerous spaces available.

We believe this will help reduce how often people will take breaks and keep productivity high, whilst also improving the mood of our residents with the unique taste of the drink.\"\n\nThat certainly sounds like a tasty beverage, however, it is odd how a sugary drink can improve productivity. Perhaps it is more readily absorbed by the body than regular purified water, containing important minerals that the body loses through perspiration, simultaneously reducing the number of toilet breaks that are needed - hopefully, that is what they mean.

They also not only help us recover but help us become better than we are.

Nuka Cherry all around, Cheers!\n\nApparently some brave soul of questionable intelligence and an over-developed adrenal gland (or just really, really high) decided enough was enough, and actually off'd the green kook. Descriptions of this individual are sketchy at best, and their motives, unknown. A member of the Operators found scouting the outskirts of the Kingdom had a few choice words: \"Screw Oswald. He played that stupid carnie music at odd hours, threw out taunts if you came too close, and those painted ghouls? Noooope. Good Riddance.\" That caps it off nicely for me. Rest in pieces, Oswald.</font>"

Up until recently, I'd have heartily discouraged you from making the trek there, but all that's changed.\n\nSome brave soul (albeit suicidal...or delusional...or possibly just out of their mind on mentats) managed to make it all the way through that kiddie maze from hell to confront the twisted mastermind at its helm, one \"Oswald the Outrageous.\" Turns out Oswald was just misunderstood (still justifiably feared, though). A trader who bumped into Oswald following this confrontation summed it up for us: \"The guy's got a big heart for his people, but had too much hope in them too.\" Turns out that crazy individual confronting Oswald convinced him that hanging out in a ghoul-filled radioactive amusement park was, perhaps, not the most productive use of his time.

As for the Gangs, after a conversation with their new \"boss,\" all remain skeptical. A couple of passing Disciples told me they \"are 50/50 on whether to slit the Overboss's throat on principle.\" Not great odds.

Thought it were a deathclaw or some greenskins so I crawled under the wagon for a better look. I got real quiet but I didn't see nobody\". For those that don't know, Old North Church was where Robert Newman, on the orders of Paul Revere, hung 2 lanterns in the steeple to warn patriots of the coming redcoats in 1775.\n\nUpon entering the church basement, authorities found a scene of utter devastation. Numerous bodies were scattered among the crypts below the church. A search of the area uncovered evidence that the catacombs were headquarters for the RailRoad, and the victims its leaders. The Institute's hatred for the RailRoad makes them the primary suspect. However, they tend to act from the shadows and in secret indicating this awful crime may have been carried out by someone else entirely. Perhaps the very synths they \"rescued\" turned on them. We may never know.</font></p>"

The Institute is Real and has finally exposed itself to the world with an announcement playing on a loop.\n\nWhile no one is sure what to make of this revelation, there has been a mixed reaction from the public. Some citizens believe they are here to help humanity, with mankind's best interests in mind. They think we should stay out of the way. Let them do what they need to with this \"reactor\" that is going online. Others are not so optimistic. There are some that believe the Institute has revealed itself for the sole purpose of killing everyone and taking over the world.

Well, Pre-war records show there's a secret government bunker under a shack with who knows what treasures.

Wreckage that sits there with unimaginable goods hidden in the cargo hold, waiting to be discovered.

It sounds like something out of the pages of a Hubris Comics adventure, but it's not. It's the unlikely story of Diamond City's only openly synth resident, Nick Valentine.\nChasing a series of pre-war holotapes, the private detective and his new partner set to unraveling Nick's toughest case...his own. Or rather, the case of the human Nick Valentine, a pre-war policeman used by the Institute to create the synth P.I. The trail of the human Valentine's old case files led to one Edward L. Winter, a notorious pre-war Mafioso who had himself deliberately ghoulified in order to cheat death. Through the efforts of Nick Valentine and his partner, this dangerous fugitive was at long, long last brought to justice, putting an end to what may well have been the Commonwealth's oldest life of crime.\n</font></p>"

The happy couple were recently married in a small outdoor ceremony at the All Faiths Chapel, with Pastor Clements presiding. While Mr. Zwicky declined to comment on the origins of his unusual relationship, his wife, Mrs. Edna Zwicky, credited the kind words of a passing stranger with giving her the push she needed to realize and confess her true feelings.

If you have any doubt as to the outcome, you have only to turn on a radio.

The exact details of the event are conflicted, and reports seem almost too fantastical to be believed.

That Edwin guy had a nice place set up here and the reservoir is in a good location with a decent water supply, but I was starting to get bored just hanging out the cabin all day. \n\nSo, when we got word that someone broke into Magnum's camp and hurt little Lily and the boss was offering a 200,000 cap bounty, I thought it might be a nice little break from the everyday boredom.  Magnum is offering 100,000 caps for their head and 200,000 caps if I bring them in alive. \n\nAnd after what they did to little Lily, I can see why the boss is so pissed. If I had spent tens of thousands of caps to protect my baby and then have some wannabe come in and hurt her like that? Well I'd offer everything I had to catch them just like Magnum is. 200 thousand caps is his entire stash. And with a bounty like that, every raider in 100 miles of Boston will be looking to collect. \n\nI sent a few of my guys out to scout around and see what they could find, but I figured, with the bounty and all, somebody would have caught them right away. So imagine my surprise when the target walked right up to the front porch! \n\nWell, staggered really. It looked like they was drunk off their ass. Of course, they wasn't too drunk to high tail it out of there soon as they saw us. I don't know what they been drinking, but remind me to stay away from it! The rumors say they're supposed to be all badass and killed dozens of raiders. HA! Probably stupid lies started by that sorry skank Venus.

I think me and the guys will stay here a while. It's a nice change from the boss and that damn parking deck. \n\nI swear, if I had lost one more of my guys to one of Magnum's stupid traps, I was going to go off. Seriously, he is way over protective of Lily. I mean, okay, she's special and he loves her and all that, but come on! There is such a thing as going overboard. \n\nI don't see why he felt the need to put traps all over that Parking Garage. And what if he needs to make a quick get away? The door to the roof is barred inside and out at all times, so unless the boss fixed it so that it can at least be opened from the inside, then the only way in and out is the door on the ground level. And with Magnum and Lily having their room up on the top floor, that means he will have to carry Lily all the way down through his own traps to get out.\n\n\nEntry #2\nThe boss has got to be mad. He wants us to catch him a Live Deathclaw. Just so he can put it on the first floor of the parking deck like a big guard dog. Hell No! Me and my guys are just going to hang out here at this cabin for a few weeks.\n\nHopefully by then, he will have come to his senses. And if not, well then big bad Magnum can do it himself. After all, he's the one that has the Power Armor. Let him catch a damn Deathclaw if it's so easy. I know Lily is a pretty little thing, and the boss wants to keep her safe. But does he really think brining in a Deathclaw to live with him is a good idea? Hell, it's bad enough he has all those feral ghouls hanging out on the 2nd floor. \n\nWhy the fuck does he need a Deathclaw added too? Hopefully he will change his mind and realize just how stupid adding a Deathclaw is. I will say this though, the way Magnum feels about his baby, god help the poor fool that gives Lily so much as a tiny little scratch.\n\n\nEntry #3\nWell, maybe that Pet Deathclaw idea Magnum had a couple weeks ago might not have been so stupid after all. It seems somebody snuck into the parking deck and somehow made it all the way to the top floor to Lily's bedside. And what's worse, they did it all drunk as hell! Word is that the intruder was so wasted, they could barely stand up straight. \n\nAnd yet they Still got past all of Magnum's traps and pets and shit. I also heard Lily's going to be okay, but Magnum is pissed. He wants the intruder found and brought to him alive. He's even put up one hell of a bounty. He's offering 100,000 caps for their head and 200,000 if they're brought in alive. Things have been quite for a while now, so maybe this will bring a bit of excitement. It would be nice and I sure would love to get my hands on the target and get that bounty. \n\nI would be set for life. 200 thousand caps is the boss's entire stash that took him over 30 years to collect and save. But I doubt it will happen. The target's probably 50 miles away from here by now, and still running. I know I would be.

msgid "I was out in the countryside, servicing an eviction notice, when the alerts came over the radio requesting that we seek immediate shelter. I was all of twenty-nine years old, recently married, nervous of the world around me.\n\nI was between farms with the city behind me. At first my thought was to slam on the brakes, turn back around and speed back home for my family - but not before coming to my senses and realizing I would never make it in time. Nanoseconds later I felt the heat of a burning light behind me - lashings of a second sun. I pulled the car to the side, rolling to a stop and bracing myself for what would come. \n\nIt was twenty minutes later, but it felt like an eternity. I finally lifted my head up from my held position to survey my surroundings. My car, hit by the shockwave but far enough to suffer little damage, yet was dead from the electromagnetic blast. Behind me, in the distance, a mushroom cloud.\n\nAfter years of open threats and outward hostility, the world powers had finally gone too far.\n\nAt first I contemplated heading back home - back to the city - but after the futility of trying to jumpstart a dead car, and with the encroaching cloud of radioactive rain on the horizon, I gave up on that idea. I decided to wait out the coming storm.\n\nI stayed in my car that night, anxious and praying to avoid some of the fallout. This car had some lead painting so it should help to shield me, I rationalized. Sleep avoided me; I spent the night listening to the howling winds thinking of my wife and newborn son, praying for their safety. Surely, I reassured myself, they made it to the bomb shelter at the local fire station.\n\nWhen the dawn brought little sun through the growing blanket of smoke in the sky, I left the safety of my vehicle and began the long journey back to the city on foot. Distantly I heard the rumblings of thunder, as into a clearing I walked to see the edges of the nuclear devastation. Barns and silos were blown in, tractors overturned, fields of wheat and corn and barley thrashed by the turbulent winds. As hours and distance passed, the devastation grew in scale. I passed through a small town, stores trashed and homes abandoned. Most from this town had fled to the local Vault, it seemed.\n\nMy work attire was not the best for long distance walking, and I began to weigh the ethics of stealing a better pair of walking shoes. I had a greater distance left to cover, and my Oxfords were never meant for endurance. Eventually I came to a decision that the old world was gone as of Saturday, entered the next home I came across and looted a pair of sneakers. I also took a snub-nosed .44, seven bullets, some water and some snack cakes. \n\nThe journey before me was a long one, so I had plenty of time to myself - and to my thoughts, not that most of those thoughts weren't ones of despair. I dwelled constantly on the fear of the unknown, namely the future that lay before me. The world; well, now the old world, had always been a hostile and frightening place for me to navigate my way through but I could always trust in the government and rule of law to protect me, to guide me, to give me security and purpose. Now, all of that was gone and it was anyone's guess as to what would replace it. Could we survive the transition? Would anarchy reign? I had yet to see another face in my travels, should I be concerned if I did?\n\nAnd my family... dear God, what if- No. I couldn't bear to continue imagining. Surely they received ample warning, and made it to the bomb shelter only a few blocks away. \n\nMy head was swirling for so long, I barely even noticed the distance I had covered or the sun's now dwindling presence in the sky. How long had it been? Had I been in a daze this whole time? More questions now. I needed to find a place to lay down for the night and soon, I could hear the rumbling of an approaching storm.\n\nA farmhouse sat distantly on the horizon, I made my way toward it with caution. Inside I found no one. The doors unlocked and left ajar, with possessions tossed haphazardly around the living space as though the occupants left in a great rush - most likely they too were on a Vault entry list. \n\nOut of nowhere came a sudden coughing fit, a very guttural and chesty one, which left me sore and exhausted once it passed. I sated my subsequent thirst and rested downstairs on a couch with the piston within reach, just for safety's sake. I dreaded the thought of using it, merely holding it in my hands and feeling its weight left me uneasy. Could I really pull the trigger on another person if I had to? Part of me believed cooler heads could still prevail despite the circumstances, but I wasn't even fooling myself at that point. \n\nDarkness came, eventually, and the rolling storm with it. The wind howled and the rain drove fiercely against the windows and shutters. I couldn't even begin to imagine the level of radiation being carried by the torrent outside. As sleep eluded me I once again began to dwell on the unknown, namely what awaited me in the city... or rather its remains. \n\nMy wife... my son... I couldn't stop thinking about them. I wanted to be with them that day, but the decision was out of my hands. Work had demanded my job be done. If I could reach out across time and strike those bastards in the face, for keeping me from them at the worst possible time...\n\nMorning came, but the gray clouds of the past storm remained overhead. Rain spat from upon high in small increments, not enough to soak or drench but just enough to be a nuisance. I crossed a recently toiled field to reach the road which on reflection was unwise given the night's rain had left it a muddy mess. So with shoes and pant cuffs soiled by the time the road was reached I continued toward the city. \n\nIt was late afternoon when I arrived at the outermost limits of the city and the farthest reach of the atomic blast's devastation. I could hear no one, see no one and nothing but destruction and chaos. I was terrified, petrified, and overcome with an intense feeling of shock and sickness to both my stomach and soul. \n\nCharred bodies littered the street which itself was lined with houses torn asunder and left smoldering in the aftermath of nuclear devastation. Roofs torn off, walls caved inward and possessions tossed outward in ruthless upheaval, striking all homes and businesses with equal ferocity and cruelty. If there was one true thing in this world, it was the bomb's true indifference to everything we had built, everything we had learned and in turn taught, everything but death.\n\nI had to find them in all of this. Dear God, I just had to. I know they would have heard the sirens, or the neighbors would have come calling and taken them along to the fire station. If I could just get there, I would see. Please, I thought to myself, please just let them have made it there.\n\nTwo streets away. A stray dog bolted from the wreck of a car with something meat-like in its mouth. I dared not stay to find out if it was animal meat or something else, by now I was at a steady jog but running short on breath. I had to stop briefly to catch my breath, something I noticed was getting harder to do. Another coughing fit, I put my hand to my mouth... this time there was blood. I notice the skin on my hands is starting to blister and peel.\n\n... what if I'm too late?\n\nFinally I reach the fire station; and at once I fall to my knees, finding all that remains is a pile of rubble. My chest tightens, my breathing staggered, and I feel the weight of the handgun in my pocket. Now all that remains is what I will accept."

msgid "Okay, so here's my story. Yo, this is going to sound like a load of bullshit, but the words written here and shared with you are one hundred percent my own. I swear this is a one hundred percent true story from a few years ago, back in DC, before I got the fuck out of there for good.\n\nFirst though, I better let you know who I am. I mean, you're probably sitting there, picking at your asshole and stuffing your face with Sugar Bombs thinking, \"Who is this clown? Thinks he's all that with a good story to tell?\" First of all, fuck you buddy! You aren't anything special! What, you think you're better than me? I'm a goddamn author, what are you - some kind of scavver?\n\nAnyway, what was I on about? Oh right, the big fuckin' robot. Oh yeah, this is a story about a big fuckin' robot.\n\nSo anyway there I was, back in the Capital Wasteland, slinging Jet with my boys Lenny and Big Doug. Those guys were tight, I dunno what happened to them but I hope they're still tearing up the wastes down there. Well, maybe not Lenny. He was one thick bastard, I remember that much. Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure that motherfucker was stealing caps from me and sneaking off to go fuck hookers. Yeah, thinking about it now that guy was an asshole.\n\nBig Doug was a good bastard though. He was one terrifying bastard, I tell ya. That's a guy you didn't want to owe caps to, he'll soon as break your fingers off and eat 'em than let you get away with unpaid debt. He stank though, like, real bad - even for a waster. Plus he was high most of the time.\n\nYeah, I'm getting to the robot! Hang on, bitch, I'm trying to set the scene. So, as I was saying, there I was slinging Jet with Lenny and Big Doug. We were hanging out around outside a raider camp not far from Dukov's Place, usually we score a few customers on their way to orgies and fights looking to get a hit of a little somethin' somethin'. Dukov's was like, I dunno, this old hotel or something from before the big war? I've only been in the lobby once, and that was to meet Lenny.\n\nHey, now I think about it that's probably when that prick started stealing from me! I remember now, I'd just offloaded some of that Psycho I found to that nutcase at Hubris Comics and Lenny was all like, \"Whoa, what's that rattling?\" and I was like, \"Guess who just made two-hundred caps?\" and then we got fucked up on the bank of the river taking pot shots at passing caravans.\n\nOh right, the big robot. Anyway, here we were - me and Lenny, and Big Doug, hanging out by the raider camp near Dukov's. Big Doug had just been dumped by his old lady so he was pretty sore and itching for a fight, and Lenny was being Lenny - that is, a fuckin' dumbass. Lemme tell ya, that guy had a brick instead of a brain. So, this one time he's telling me a story about how he single-handedly outsmarted a group of mercenaries after they caught him stealing food. Please, he couldn't outsmart Brahmin shit.\n\nBig Doug wasn't really the sharpest tool in the toolbox either. Nobody ever asked why his missus dumped him, though. Fuck that, he'd have grabbed my skull with one hand and crushed it like a mutfruit, that boy liked his privacy.\n\nAlright, fuck! The robot! Okay, me and Lenny and Big Doug, raider camp, Big Doug's pissed, Lenny's an idiot. So Big Doug's looking for a fight and he says, \"I swear to God you guys, next person who walks around the corner I'm gonna kick his fuckin' ass; crack his fuckin' throat, rip open his guts and shit in 'em! That fuckin' lyin' bitch, that lyin' bitch!\" and so on, and so on.\n\nAnd who should walk around the corner? None other than the nutcase himself Goalie Ledoux, leader of one of them ice gangs. Now, for those of you numbskulls who don't know none, Ledoux and his ice gag called themselves... shit, what did they call themselves? Who fuckin' cares, anyway, all you need to know is that this guy was one violent son-of-a-bitch. Oh, and he always wore this stupid mask that made him look like a retard.\n\nI don't know if this was true, but the guy was a nutcase because he was addicted to Nuka Cola. Apparently he was trying to steal its secret formula or some shit? \n\nAnyway, so he comes around the corner. I figure he's on his way to get literally fucked at Dukov's, who cares. I turned to look at Big Doug whose face was white with shame and fear. Not even a big fuck like him would want to tangle with the likes of Ledoux. Lenny, though, big fuckin' idiot that he is, shouts out at him, \"Hey bro! My guy here wants to kick your ass!\"\n\nOf course Ledoux heard this, and he turns around to look at us. Big Doug's definitely shitting himself by now, and I'm looking to just get out of Ledoux's war path. You know this was the kinda guy to kill everyone in his path and while I liked Big Doug's odds, I didn't wanna be around in the aftermath if he lost. I remember Big Doug saying \"Shut the fuck up, fuckwit!\" to Lenny, but it was already too late. Ledoux had been summoned, and an ass-kicking was coming.\n\nNow, lemme tell you something about Big Doug. When he starts fighting, he goes into this kinda mungo-rage mode. I tell ya, it's a thing of beauty; like someone flicked a switch in his brain and turned off everything except bloodlust and fury. I once seen him give a ghoul a flying headbutt before tackling it to the ground and punching in its chest. I'm telling ya, this guy was furious in a fight, and he didn't stop until the other guy was paste. But when he saw Ledoux walking toward us, arms outstretched in invitation to an ass-whooping, it's like he started to shrink away.\n\nNow, I ain't proud of this next bit, but the fact that I'm alive and telling you all this shit means it was probably a good idea. Never mind what actually happened, but if a fight started then what I did would have helped. I pulled out a pack of Psycho, shuffled behind Big Doug, and stuck him in the ass with it. Hey, it probably wasn't the only time he was stuck in the ass with a psycho.\n\nBut boy, did that motherfucker howl. Lenny just about shat himself. Ledoux stopped and seemed pretty spooked as well, but I don't think it was because of Big Doug. I felt like a genius, and when Big Doug stepped forward to start rushing Ledoux I swear I felt the ground shake. But, it turns out, it wasn't for my genius move that Big Doug had the perceived strength to rock the ground he stood on. \n\nLedoux turned tail and ran toward Dukov's, and I yelled at him to \"Run, motherfucker!\", just as I felt a bigger rumble in the ground coming from behind me. Now, this is where the crazy shit starts.\n\nI turned around and saw the biggest fuckin' robot I've ever seen. Lenny must've seen it before me because that thick shit was already running for Dukov's as well. Big Doug? He started running *toward* the big fuckin' robot. It was shouting some bullshit about something, communists? I dunno, but holy shit I kid you the fuck not, that motherfuckin' thing was throwing nukes and shooting lasers at a bunch of dudes in power armor. I decided I was not sticking around to find out what the Hell it said it was bringing, and I was done hanging around DC while it was in town.\n\nSo yeah, I ran. I didn't run because I was scared, you fuckwit. What, you think you'd hang around with a giant robot that throws bombs at you, hot stuff? Ohh, I bet you think you're a fuckin' tough guy, huh? Well I tell you what, you can go fuck yourself. Go on, put down my book, tuck your penis between your legs and find a comfy chair to sit on and GO. FUCK. YOURSELF. \n\nSo I dunno what happened to the guys. Lenny, Big Doug, Ledoux, Big Doug's old lady and her brother the butt-banger, but I did hear that that big fuckin' robot is still kicking it down in the Capital Wasteland. There were whispers and rumors that someone managed to blow it up, I dunno. All I know is that it's not here in Boston, and that's far enough away from me.\n\nAlright, you can stop writing now bro, I'm done talking. Have you thought of a title for me? \n\nI don't get it."

msgid "There are travelers from the north who speak of a place along the foreboding coastline and beyond the dead woods. Many have told of some kind of presence, a compelling force, that keeps them away. Stories of explorers gazing upon a strange sight, only to be struck down by something unseen.\n\nI once met one of these travelers, at a bar in Salem some years ago, by the name of Bartlet. He and his ward Leo were mercenaries from a small township on the outskirts of the Amesbury ruins. Bartlet, a black man in his mid 50's, was well worn from his travels and over a glass of Gwinnett ale spoke of his experiences.\n\nIt had been some years prior, both Bartlet and Leo had been contracted by a group of tech scavengers to locate a few key components, notably some kind of fabled \"infinite energy source\", for their ongoing research. These scavengers had directed him first to the Mass Fusion headquarters in Boston; there, he was told, he might find some kind of inkling as to where to proceed. Bartlet told me he had taken worse jobs with less information and so accepted on condition of an up front payment of thirty-five percent of the promised amount.\n\nAt this time he was more than two people - in fact there were six others. Time and age had made fools of both him and Leo, however, as names escaped them both. Something much more had made worse of Leo, who sat silent through my conversation with Bartlet with eyes fixed to the floor.\n\nTheir squad suffered no foul nor setback on their journey further south into the Commonwealth wastes, eventually reaching Bunker Hill to rest for some days before entering the city proper. Locals warned of the dangers that downtown Boston harbored but, undeterred, Bartlet insisted upon his crew that they undertake the remains of the journey.\n\nThey had been forewarned of the presence of a group of organized mercenaries who called themselves Gunners, recently reported to be occupying the area. A gang of ruthless violent misfits, they were cautioned; however Bartlet mused that like most mercenaries, once paid, they were very accommodating. The Gunners had allowed them to enter and search for documentation which might aid them, however were let down that over half of the building's upper floors were inaccessible. Terminals were scrubbed of data - or destroyed. As expected, though nonetheless they were dejected.\n\nAt once five of the squad members had broken away, disappointed in the outcome of traveling this far to have had no success, and took up offers from these Gunners. But Bartlet remained determined, especially now that there would be fewer people to split the caps with at the end of it all. Eventually a locked computer yielded a result - the name of a researcher at a pre-War institute of technology who was commissioned to assist in the development of a classified technology.  The search was to continue.\n\nOnly two others remained by his side, a woman named Charlie and of course Leo. Bartlet stared into the middle distance at his mentioning of Charlie, realizing aloud that this had been the first time he had talked about her in several years. He seemed to hold some regret over her. Bartlet talked briefly about a raider ambush, but refused to say anymore. Leo stirred in his seat, remaining silent.\n\nHaving reached Cambridge on the other side of the Charles, the trio set to work on scavenging specific sites in certain sections of what was once long ago the Commonwealth Institute of Technology. The halls and campus buildings, long abandoned, were a veritable cornucopia of relics and information from a bygone era. But, for as good as the technology and research was that they had found, it was not enough. Bartlet, in his own words, wanted that white whale.\n\nHe would get his next morsel of information in a lecture hall, where he found the notebook of one Professor Horatio Ziegler. Inside, amongst incomprehensible information, he found the professor's home address and mention of what he believed he was looking for - the beryllium agitator. Sadly, this wasn't a treasure map where \"X marks the spot\" so once again he, Leo and Charlie continued onward.\n\nThe professor's house, to Bartlet's recollection, had remained in relatively good condition for nearly two-hundred years of dereliction. It took some work to crack open the front door's lock, Leo eventually settling on a low-yield explosive. Inside however, they found nothing to point them forward. No clues, no notes, not even any noteworthy technology or scrap to take back with them.\n\nBartlet was bordering on obsession by this point, he freely admitted, sucking down the last of his ale as he did. He motioned to Leo saying this next part was his idea, as it was him who took a keener interest in this Professor Ziegler's notebook. While the three of them continued to scour Ziegler's house, he read over notes discussing technology which at this point in history seemed fabled; unlimited energy generation, plasma-based energy shields, something to do with \"Abramelin fields\", but most importantly repeated mention of a place along the coast.\n\nAs Bartlet said, \"We referred to it as the Lost City of 'Sea.\"\n\nAfter a night's rest, they decided they would make for the coast and travel north as far as they could. Charlie and Leo, as accommodating as they were up until that point to enable Bartlet's obsession had been growing weary of the travel, but at Bartlet gave assurances that this would be the last place they would visit before giving up the hunt. Perhaps at this \"lost city\" they might at last find this energy source. \n\nIt took them two days to get as far as Mahkra Fish-packing, agreeing between the three of them that should they become separated they were to rally back here. It was from here where Bartlet's memory became patchy - namely for what followed. He barely remembered passing a homestead on the coast and taking to a man named Taichi and his son Kenji before moving over the hills toward the dead woods that covered the landscape and seemingly stretched to the horizon, beyond where the road burnt out and turned to dirt and dust.\nThey had followed a winding trail through the dead woods, fighting off bloodbugs and bloatflies and scaring away some small herds of radstag does while following the sounds of crashing waves off to their right as a means of navigation. \n\nThen suddenly, as Bartlet recalls, it was as if the dead woods folded away and they found themselves staring upon a clearing.\n\nAnd then, the tormenting pain. Although he tells me of how his memory goes black at this point, Bartlet can remember the intense burning sensation he felt coming from inside his body, as though his internal organs were being cooked. He remembers his vision going gray and spotty, and almost immediately being overcome with unimaginable headache pain. After that, all he remembers is waking up on a raft floating off the coast on calm waters, slowly drifting toward the shore just north of Mahkra Fish-packing.\n\nHe would wait four days for the other two to come back, only on the fifth day did a second raft float down with Leo on board. When Bartlet asked of Charlie, Leo spoke the last words he had said ever since, \"She's not coming back.\"\n\nEnding the tale there, Bartlet tossed his empty bottle into a bag he had slung over his shoulder. I pried a bit more, asking if he had any idea what it was he thinks he found out there.\n\n\"Only he could tell you that,\" Bartlet replied, pointing to Leo, \"But he doesn't say much at all these days.\"\n\nI asked why Leo would know more, as I sat on tenterhooks.\n\n\"Because he made it inside the clearing, and back out again.\""

msgid "The Citadel was eerily quiet that day as the young Initiate was marched through the hallways to stand before his superiors and deliver his testimony. Members of the Brotherhood whom were not at privilege to sit in on the closed-door testimony watched on, some whispering between each other but all of them watching with unfounded perspicaciousness. \n\nThe young Initiate walked with a limp, his head still bandaged and his eye still patched. Flanked by two Paladins, and led by a Sentinel, the young Initiate's heart was aflutter at the prospect of what awaited him in the room ahead. The doors swung open, the young Initiate and company entered into the impromptu courtroom. Today, the last survivor was facing judgement.\n\nKnight-Captain Braddock flicked through the small pile of discovery evidence afforded to him by the prosecution, as it was his appointed duty to act on behalf of the young Initiate's defense. He had had very little time to prepare, and spent little time beforehand even studying the basics of law, however remained somewhat confident in his ability.\n\nThe trial before him was thus; a vertibird had crashed while fleeing an active combat zone killing all but one on board, including the recently appointed Elder of the Brotherhood. Only the young Initiate survived, and gave a questionable explanation as to the cause of the crash - one which had stunned his superiors and forced this investigative trial.\n\nBraddock had no reason to believe him and in fact did not; he believed that the accident was just that, an accident. However he was duty bound to protect him; the Brotherhood followed codes of honor, and did its best to uphold some sense of justice, so he could do no less. The young Initiate was seated, and the trial began.\n\nThree Sentinels presided over the trial, the senior-most of the three spoke, \"Please state your name, for the record.\"\n\nThe young Initiate cleared his throat, \"M-My name is Marsden, sir. Alex Marsden, Initiate in the Brotherhood of Steel.\"\n\n\"Do you swear before this Council that the testimony you are about to deliver is the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?\"\n\nMarsden's eyes panned over the room cautiously, \"I do,\" he replied.\n\n\"Then let's proceed with your testimony, if you will,\" the Sentinel concluded, gesturing for Marsden to begin.\n\nThe Initiate cleared his throat again, as both Braddock and the prosecution leaned in to show their attention.\n\n\"We were under heavy fire, a group of super mutants had us pinned down near L'Enfant Plaza. We radioed in for an airlift, but in the meantime had to hold them off. The Elder...\" he trailed off, seemingly choked up, before continuing, \"The Elder distinguished herself in combat trying to defend as best as she could however did sustain a rather severe leg wound. We had to get her out of her power armor so that I could assess the damage. I have basic field medic training, you see.\"\n\n\"Please, go on,\" the Sentinel interrupted, \"From the airlift up until the crash.\"\n\nInitiate Marsden shifted in his seat, seemingly uneasy recounting the events that unfolded that day. He cleared his throat a third time, \"Airlift came in without much trouble, we got the Elder on board first and held off immediate resistance long enough to get in the air before their reinforcements arrived...\"\n\nHe trailed off and looked to the middle distance. The Sentinel interjected, \"So what went wrong?\"\n\nMarsden continued staring, \"I don't know. Next thing I remember is, we were spiraling downward and... and that's it.\"\n\nThe Sentinel sat back in his chair, hands clasped. \"Does this conclude your testimony today?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Initiate Marsden plainly replied.\n\n\"Very good, the prosecution has the floor.\"\n\nThe member of the prosecution stood. He was a Paladin, and a remarkably young man; with a distinguishing scar on his face, a powerful stance, and an intimidating scowl. \n\n\"Initiate Marsden, in your opening statement you mentioned that the vertibird you were in began spiraling downward. Is this correct?\"\n\n\n\"Yes, that is correct Paladin.\"\n\n\"Do you recall if there had been an impact against the vehicle when this occurred?\"\n\n\"An impact, like a..?\"\n\n\"Like a missile, an explosion, something thrown by a behemoth?\"\n\n\"No, I don't recall anything like that. It just started spinning, very fast.\"\n\nThe Paladin furrowed his brow, as if confused, \"Initiate, do you know much about vertibirds? How they operate?\"\n\n\"I did some basic training as a field mechanic during rotations,\" the Initiate replied.\n\n\"Do you know about a device, rather, a series of devices which are on board every vertibird; devices like rotational dampers? Or the auto-tilt gyroscopic stabilizer, the ATGS?\"\n\n\"I- I'm vaguely familiar with them.\"\n\n\"Do you know what they do?\"\n\n\"The rotational dampers will balance out the necessary workload on each turbine to prevent burnout, and the ATGS... I'm not one hundred percent certain.\"\n\n\"It helps to maintain rotational balance during normal flight operations.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Right, and so to the best of your knowledge there was no exterior impact that could have either damaged or destroyed one of the engines after take-off?\"\n\n\"I don't remember feeling any impact, we just started spinning downward very fast.\"\n\nThe Paladin seemed to have a half-scowl, as though insulted, \"Do you know how many vertibirds the Brotherhood has lost since bringing them into service?\"\n\n\"No, Paladin.\"\n\n\"12. Do you know how many times a vertibird has had to be put down in an emergency for repairs?\"\n\n\"Too many times to count, I'd imagine, Pala-\"\n\n\"612,\" the Paladin cut in. \"And of those times do you know how many of them have been due to issues or faults with either the rotational dampers or the ATGS?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"None.\"\n\nThe short silence was palpable. \"There are only a few other ways that a vertibird can come down in a way you're describing, and they wouldn't reflect well on a man who isn't here to defend himself.\"\n\n\"I'm not saying it was human error, Paladin, I just -\"\n\n\"Then what are you saying, Initiate?\" the Paladin rebutted, with a sting in his words, \"You are the only survivor of this crash that killed our Elder, and you are seemingly making some bold assertions for us to infer.\"\n\nThe Paladin paced as he talked, first away from and then toward Initiate Marsden, \"So if you're not saying it was an accident caused by an attack, nor was it human error, I'm wondering if you could explain to me Initiate just how a vertibird spirals out of the sky. Not a controlled downward rotation for a hard landing, an out of control spiral.\"\n\n\"I... I don't know.\"\n\n\"You don't know?\" the Paladin seemed bemused, \"Are you stupid?\"\n\n\"N-no.\"\n\n\"Then why can't you tell me?\"\n\n\"I uh... I don't see how it could spiral down uncontrolled.\"\n\nThe Paladin turned from the Initiate to pace again.\n\n\"But it did, didn't it?\" the Paladin continued, \"It did, and now we're here with you as our only witness, and with only one possibility. Initiate Marsden, do you believe this accident was an act of sabotage?\"\n\nThe Initiate, now unsteady and anxious, darted his eyes across the seated gallery of other Brotherhood members, all of them now murmuring indistinctly among one another.\n\nThe Sentinel banged his fist on the metal table at which he sat, to gain back control of the room.\n\n\"The gallery is to remain silent if they wish to remain at these proceedings. Paladin, I will advise you to stay away from speculation at this time and stick to what facts we have at hand. We have neither the time nor the desire to go looking down endless rabbit-holes.\"\n\n\"Of course, Sentinel, I had no further questions for this witness,\" and with that the Paladin took his seat, and looked to the defense briefly before looking back over his notes. Knight-Captain Braddock needed more time to assess his position with his client, Marsden, and so quickly took action.\n\n\"Sentinel, in light of new accusations leveled against my client I would like to request a brief recess in order to provide counsel.\"\n\n\"Very well, a short recess will be given for you to counsel your client,\" the Sentinel pounded his fist again, \"This court is now in recess and will reconvene in ten minutes time.\"\n\nThe Knight-Captain was beginning to sweat bullets. This case was shaping up to be one of the most important in these modern times, and he knew it. He could not afford to mess this up, history would be watching."

msgid "It was one quarter past the midday sun when me and me boys happen'd across a group of vaulters scruffin' the wastes. We had just partooken in a spot of brahmin milk and ayahuasca and were feelin' up to snuff for a round of violence, but even in me spotty state this look'd like too easy pickin'.\n\nMe and me chums, that is I, Oleg; and me chums, Paulie, Greg, and Dozer; were perch'd upon a rock lookin' at the vaulters as they kick'd about in the muck, all hudd'd around and lookin' for somethin' down there.\n\nThe sun beat down, makin' me woozl'd and anxious. Mayhaps milk was a bad choice on such a stinkin' hot day. Paulie and Greg champ'd, also woozl'd and anxious, hoppin' mad and ready for a fight. \n\n\"Alright lads,\" I said, adjustin' me hat, \"Let us go now, and clock these clowns in the noggin, yeah? Bash in their brains, crack 'em open, like deathclaw eggy-weggs!\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah! Let's get 'em boss!\" Dozer chortl'd, about set to bust open his gut with chucklin'.\n\nI stood up to give me cry out, and see to a fair bit of violence, \"Ho down there!\" I did scream, wavin' as I did, \"You sorry lot are about to be feelin' even sorrier!\"\n\nMe chums, that is Paulie, Greg and Dozer, had already start'd runnin' before me. \n\nI was to jump down of the rock but not before noticin' the vaulters hadn't even turn'd to look at us. Mayhaps it were just the ayahuasca, I thought, but somethin' didn't feel right about this.\n\nI didn't run like me chums, but kept me bat at the ready. The midday sun work'd a sweat out of me, and the milk gave a churnin' in me gut that did feel good so not. Paulie, Greg and Dozer were nearly at the vaulters and, for all their hootin' and hollerin', they had still not turn'd to see us. Could be they deaf, or just that dumb so?\n\nThen as me chums reach'd the vaulters they at once vanish'd into a bright light, and a hotter heat hit me at me front. Of course it were a trap, and now me chums were dead. Somethin' tapp'd me shoulder and, before I turn'd, a bag was over me head and I got bonk'd.\n\n\n***\n\n\nWhen it was I did wake, I did see that I was underground. The bag on me head was gone, but I was stuck to me chair and couldn't stand. Some time must've pass'd, as the ayahuasca had run its course. Me gut still churn'd but much lower, and I had worry of makin' a mess for some poor schmucko to clean up.\n\nI rattl'd me arms against what had they restrain'd me, hopin' to gain some attention. I call'd to whoever would answer.\n\n\"Hello? Who is it what's got me?\" I did call out.\n\n\"The subject will remain silent until the Doctor arrives.\"\n\nI didn't much fancy how that sound'd.\n\n\"Who is the 'doctor'? What need does he have of me, hm?\"\n\n\"The subject will remain silent until the Doctor arrives, or he will be gagged.\"\n\n\"Can 'the subject' let be known where he is?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nTime pass'd, as time does. To pass the quiet I did hum me a tune, one which did please me so. Lucky it was that whoever wait'd outside did not come in to gag me for it as I must've sound'd mighty pleas'd with meself.\n\nThe door in front kachunk'd itself open and there stood a pretty bird in white smock with hair that bobb'd with each step.\n\n\"Well now, don't you look a sight!\" She did say with cajun spice in her voice. \"Welcome to Vault 62, I'm Doctor Ryan, and our glorious Overseer has permitted you to receive rehabilitation!\"\n\nShe then grabb'd a needle with some otherish blue-black goop within,\"Well, sister, that's sounds viddy well,\" I did say, \"But it strikes me unwell to be bound, so what say you loosen me 'round the cuffs, eh?\"\n\n\"Oh my, no, I don't think we'll be doing that,\" She smil'd a devilish smile, \"We can't have you able to interfere with us while we undertake your rehabilitation!\"\n\nI felt a stone's bulge in me throat, sinkin' to me stomach, \"So we ain't all gonna be sittin' in circles then, singin' camp songs about Jesus and holdin' bleedin' hands?\"\n\nThe pretty bird tik-tik'd her finger on the needle makin' the goop wriggle around, and makin' me queasy gut turn once more, \"No,\" she did say, stretchin' the word, \"Nothing like that.\"\n\nThe door did open with a cracking whip, and in walk'd a bald man in white smock. He look'd over me, his face curlin' in disgust.\n\n\"Is the subject ready to undertake the procedure?\" He ask'd of the pretty bird, \"Sedative administered?\"\n\n\"I was just about to when you walked in, Doctor,\" the pretty bird did reply, brushin' her hand on her smock, \"Have you any news to relay from the Overseer, or are you here to assist?\"\n\n\"I've been instructed to assist you, Doctor Ryan,\" did say the bald man, \"These particulars have been quite irksome to the residents of nearby settlements out on the surface, and the last thing we'd want to happen is to have this one break free and run amok through here.\"\n\nThe bald man took one more look over me, sneerin' like he did, \"You didn't shave his head while he was unconscious?\"\n\n\"Oh but Doctor,\" the pretty bird said, \"There's so little hair up top I figured it wouldn't matter once the scalp was removed.\"\n\n\"'Scalp was removed'!?\" I did shout, me voice ringin' in the room with an echo, \"Hang on, what's all this for 'rehabilitation'? What game are you playin'?\"\n\nThe bald man then did say, \"In order to rehabilitate, we must get into the folds of your brain. You don't need to worry, the good Doctor Ryan here is going to sedate you well enough that you won't feel a thing,\" he did smile a wick'd smile, \"Think of it like the ultimate trip, must stronger than that gunk you drink on the surface.\"\n\nNow that did settle me, \"Welly welly well, say no more, say no more!\" That is, I did still hold worry for some thing, \"I will feel no pain, is that it brother?\"\n\n\"In fact, I'm positive you won't,\" did say the bald man, \"Doctor Ryan, sedate the subject please.\"\n\nThe pretty bird then did find me vein, and stabb'd in the needle, fillin' me blood with the blue-black goop. I was out like a light.\n\nBut not for long, as I woke to a great clutter in me brain. It sounded like a ripper, tearin' inside me head, though it true I did feel nothin' I still did crack me eyes. \n\nWhen proper wake did I, I did find meself more secur'd than before. Me eyes, clos'd as they were, had now been clamp'd open and fix'd at a screen, while me head still achin' and throbbin' was seemingly strapp'd down to somethin'.\n\nI could hear burblin' about somethin' called 'Vulfgang', 'clockwork operations', and 'evocation', but groggy as I be could make no sense. A drop fell in each of me open eyes, unable to blink I started to groan and cry like some babe achin' for mother's tit.\n\nI tried crying out, asking for someone to stop and remove my restraints. Suddenly, the screen before me flicker'd on, and I saw such wonder. Scenes of a beautiful world, one without the ravages of nearly two centuries of decay, neglect and death. Images of people, real people, not savages of a desolate wasteland. People still naive of what was to come.\n\nI could feel something in my brain, something almost electric, pulsing throughout sending goose pimples over my body. There were some images that flashed which seemed to merely be blurs while others seemed as nostalgic as memory. I could hear burbling of someone ordering \"more voltage\". More drops in my eyes, I fought hard to blink but nonetheless could not.\n\nAnd then there was music, such wonderful music, I had never heard anything like it before. The imagery, the sound, it enveloped me. The sedative in my blood, the electrical pulses in my brain, the eye drops, the power of it all washed over me over and over. I don't know how long I was there for, restrained, taking this all in.\n\n***\n\nWhen I woke the next morning nothing felt as it did previously. I rubbed my head to feel something synthetic, smooth and yet familiar. I stood up from the bed and approached the nearby dresser, removed a vault suit from it and put it on. I stepped out of my room and made my way down a seemingly familiar hallway to a seemingly familiar destination.\n\nEntering a large, open atrium, I crossed it to reach a cafeteria. I walked among other vault dwellers, and they walked by me as my equals with no hint of suspicion or fright, nor I of any ill will or unfamiliarity. I walked to the fruit bar, hungry as I was, and collected myself a nice juicy mutfruit.\n\nBiting into it, and with a smile, I thought, \"I was cured, alright. God bless the Overseer.\""
