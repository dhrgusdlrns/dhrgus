msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0200D54B]"
msgid "I've managed to find out where they had a stash of these seeds stored away. If we retreieve them, we can increase the yields here."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0200D578]"

msgid "Mom was sick. Radiation poisoning probably. We moved into town and I looked after her for a while, but it was a losing battle."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DE01]"
msgid "I picked up a lot of experience off the back of what they taught me, and I'm happy to share those ideas with you now."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DECC]"
msgid "They had lost their own children early on, so they decided to raise me themselves. I joined the family business soon as I was old enough."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201E0BF]"
msgid "Of course, they would have said their most valuable find of all was me. They found me all alone, abandoned in some ruins during one of their runs."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DCDC]"
msgid "They could take just about anything you could find and turn it into something useful. I learned everything I know about salvage from them."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DD59]"
msgid "They were junk traders. Ran a caravan that went up and down a good chunk of the coast. Wasn't a charmed lifestyle, but we could usually stay fed."

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DFB5]"
msgid "Even mirelurks and feral ghouls, if you can believe it. Guess they like the shiny stuff same as we do. Anyway, the best stuff is in those trunks."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DCAE]"
msgid "That other stuff is what we need. Good news is that most baddies of the Commonwealth seem to be collectors in their own right."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DD1E]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DDB0]"
msgid "Actually...well, what you really should look for are red and green steamer trunks. They seem to be the gold standard of valuable storage around here."

msgctxt "[0201DE33]"
msgid "Let me just upload the coordinates to your Pip-Boy and... done. Be careful out there, okay?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DF3E]"

msgid "Gotcha, I'll see who else is available. Come talk to me if you ever feel like making a run."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DF40]"

msgid "Awesome! This will really get the ball rolling. Thank you!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DED5]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DE9D]"
msgid "What we need now is for people to head out on salvage runs and bring it back. Would you be interested in heading out there?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201E001]"
msgid "And to do that, we need to bring in things from outside. Of course, the best scrap tends to collect in the most dangerous places. Go figure, right?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DCBF]"
msgid "We'll still be able to crank out lots of stuff for you, but to really get the most out of this, we need to go the extra mile."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DD2F]"
msgid "Great! So, we have our junkyard up and running now, but what we need is something to really work with. More than what we can find in town, that is."

msgctxt "[0201DDD5]"
msgid "\"We find a use for things that everybody else has left behind,\" as my parents would say. Anyway, that's the basis for the idea. Interested?"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201E248]"

msgctxt "[0201E064]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DF88]"
msgid "Wherever the item goes, death and destruction follow. It's hard to spot in the Wasteland, but it left a more obvious trail... before the bombs fell."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DE50]"

msgctxt "[0201DE8D]"

msgctxt "[0201DF86]"
msgid "You don't have to believe me. Nobody does. But... that item you have destroys lives."

msgctxt "[0201E000]"
msgid "In due time. You've done a service that must be repaid."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DCCB]"
msgid "But if you found the item... why risk bringing it to me, and how did you avoid its curse?"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201E0E9]"
msgid "My Protectron informs me you've delivered the item, but... oh my. It seems you aren't the people I hired."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DEFC]"
msgid "But I'm done with all that. Here, take it... I insist. Consider it a bonus!"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0201DE52]"

msgctxt "[020478D4]"
msgid "And while it's far from a perfect reproduction, it may be similar enough that we can use parts of it to repair our Hub."

msgctxt "[0204760E]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[02047646]"
msgid "Just what kinda ASAM technology were Vault-Tec tryna copy here?"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[02047827]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[020477BE]"
msgid "Oh, right. Of course you do! Sorry, didn't mean to patronize. Sometimes I forget you understand this kinda stuff."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[020477BF]"
msgid "Think about it! You powered down the ASAMs, and the signals stopped broadcasting. Therefore, the ASAMs were creating the signals."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[020478C3]"
msgid "The ASAMs. They were emitting the radio signals that this machine was tryna pick up. When you turned off the power, we stopped the signals."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[0204763B]"
msgid "Exactly. When you shut off the power to the ASAMs, we shut off the signal. Simple deduction."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[02047716]"

msgctxt "[020477E5]"

msgstr "오?"

msgctxt "[02047883]"

msgctxt "[020476D1]"

msgstr ""

msgctxt "[02047903]"

msgctxt "[02047682]"

msgctxt "[02047682]"
